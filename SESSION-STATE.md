## Current Task
Pre-compaction flush complete. Massive build session done — all core infra, 5 skills, cron, GPU env, research toolkit built.

## Recent Context
- 2026-02-28: Leo corrected writing preference — file names should be English-only. For paper support, assistant should draft content proactively for Leo to review.
- 2026-02-28: Leo asks for a natural default mechanism so every new research idea is automatically checked for overlap/novelty before deep investment.
- 2026-02-28: Decision update — Leo wants to focus midday on near-term submission research; slower tasks (e.g., Pathfinder/budget and non-urgent admin) defer until after 2026-03-05 AoE.
- 2026-02-28: Priority reorder — Leo will write Results first before Abstract/Related Work.
- L-07 (SYNC_PROTOCOL smoke test) still waiting on Mac Leo merge confirmation
- QUICK_START.md partially written
- All changes pushed to lab-desktop (latest: b822ba9)
- 5 cron jobs active: heartbeat, scanner, merge, calendar, tunnel
- Self-improve seeded: 6 learnings + 4 errors in JSONL

## Pending Decisions
- Weekly OpenClaw auto-update cron: add or skip?
- 彤恩姐 scholarship conflict confirmation (僑生獎學金 vs 研究獎助生)

## Session Notes
- This was a 12+ hour build session covering 8 tasks + 3 skill integrations + senior review
- Boot flow, WAL, VBR, working buffer all coded into AGENTS.md
- Next priorities: L-07 verification, copy toolkit to Battleship, help Mac with M-02/M-03
