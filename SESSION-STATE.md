L-08 財務管理 — 查獎學金 deadline、TA 空缺、收入策略
Leo 說實驗不要我處理，專注其他任務

## Recent Context

- QUICK_START.md partially written
- All changes pushed to lab-desktop (latest: b822ba9)
- 5 cron jobs active: heartbeat, scanner, merge, calendar, tunnel
- Self-improve seeded: 6 learnings + 4 errors in JSONL

## Pending Decisions
- Weekly OpenClaw auto-update cron: add or skip?
- 彤恩姐 scholarship conflict confirmation (僑生獎學金 vs 研究獎助生)

## Session Notes
- This was a 12+ hour build session covering 8 tasks + 3 skill integrations + senior review
- Boot flow, WAL, VBR, working buffer all coded into AGENTS.md
- Next priorities: L-07 verification, copy toolkit to Battleship, help Mac with M-02/M-03
