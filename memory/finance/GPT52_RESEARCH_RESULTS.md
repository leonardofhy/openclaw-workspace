Below is what I could **verify from official (or clearly primary) sources** as of **Feb 28, 2026 (Asia/Taipei)**, plus a few items that are **explicitly flagged as uncertain** when the official sources don’t publish a deadline or details are behind dynamic forms.

I’m prioritizing opportunities that are plausibly relevant to your profile (NTU master’s, Malaysian citizen, AI safety / interpretability / speech, currently receiving **NSTC/國科會** RA stipend).

### LTFF: realistic grant size + what wins

* **Verified range**: EA Funds indicates grants typically range **$1k–$500k**. ([Effective Altruism Funds][2])
* A practical “master’s-student realistic” request (my inference, not an official claim): **low five figures** is often easier to justify than six figures unless you’re proposing a clearly scoped, high-leverage project with strong evidence you can deliver. Think: **$5k–$50k** for a defined slice like compute/API credits + living stipend for a short sprint + travel.
* “Successful application shape” (grounded in common funder criteria + Alignment Project’s explicit criteria): clear **problem**, **method**, **milestones**, **deliverables**, **why you’re the person**, and a **tight budget**; show feasibility/track record; be explicit about counterfactual impact and risks. The Alignment Project’s published assessment criteria (relevance/feasibility/innovation/actionability/team) is a good template even for LTFF-style grants. ([AI Security Institute][10])

### What I could NOT verify (Category 1 items you asked about)

I did **not** locate verified, currently-open 2026 student-facing grant/fellowship pages (from official sources) for: **SERI, Conjecture, Redwood, ARC, CAIS compute grants**, etc. Some of these orgs often recruit via **job postings** rather than standing “apply for a grant” pages; if you want, I can do a second pass focusing only on those orgs’ official careers/grants pages and current openings.

### Malaysian sources you asked for but I did not verify this round

* **FAATUM (留台聯總)** scholarships
* **各州中華大會堂** (隆雪/柔佛 etc.)
* **Dong Jiao Zong (董教總 / 華教基金會)** postgraduate funding
* **Yayasan Khazanah / Bank Negara / Petronas** postgraduate abroad scholarships

If you want, I can do a targeted pass on just these Malaysian sources and return only items with **official** PDFs/pages + deadlines.

### Taiwan private items you asked for but I did not verify this round

* **台達電子文教基金會** scholarships
* **台積電 (master’s) scholarships** beyond the **PhD** program
* **聯發科 (general master’s scholarships)** beyond the IC design program travel support
* Other private foundations for STEM master’s students that accept “境外生”

# TOP 5 highest-ROI opportunities for you

Ranked by **(expected $/impact) × probability × effort**, considering your profile and constraints.

1. **The Alignment Project (UK AISI / DSIT)** — Huge upside (up to **£1m**), global eligibility, and your topic (mechanistic interpretability) is explicitly within their priority areas (they list “Interpretability” as a research priority). Start prepping now for **summer 2026 reopen**. ([AI Security Institute][10])
2. **LTFF (EA Funds Long‑Term Future Fund)** — Rolling, flexible, and plausibly fundable at a scale that matches an early‑career researcher. Good fit for “mechanistic interpretability × speech/multimodal LLMs” as a concrete project with milestones. ([Effective Altruism Funds][2])
3. **中技社 境外生研究獎學金 (CTCI)** — Clear fit as a **境外生** STEM master’s student; **NT$150k** is meaningful; application window historically summer. ([ctci.org.tw][23])
4. **MATS (Autumn 2026)** — Great for alignment track record + mentorship + stipend. The main cost is logistics: being away from NTU and ensuring your NSTC RA role allows it. ([MATS Program][3])
5. **Interspeech travel grants (once 2026 page opens) + ISCA student membership** — Lower $$ but high probability and very low effort if you have an accepted paper; membership can be an eligibility enabler. ([isca-students.org][22])

# Urgent actions (deadlines within 30 days)

1. **GovAI DC Summer Fellowship 2026 — deadline Mar 1, 2026 (ET)**
   Only worth doing if you already have **US work authorization**, since they don’t sponsor visas. ([GovAI][7])
2. **TaiwanICDF Scholarship — deadline Mar 15, 2026**
   Likely not applicable if you’re already enrolled at NTU, but if there’s any edge-case eligibility, you must confirm immediately. ([ROC Taiwan][13])
3. **Interspeech 2026 paper submission appears already past (Feb 25, 2026 AoE)**
   If you were targeting Interspeech 2026 submission for AudioMatters, verify whether any extension exists; otherwise plan for a different venue or Interspeech 2027. ([interspeech2026.org][19])

# Anything you should NOT apply for (high confidence waste of time)

* **MARA GrEP** — official documents require **Bumiputera** (and often no double sponsorship), so not eligible as Chinese Malaysian. ([mara.gov.my][14])
* **TSMC PhD Scholarship (2026)** — requires **ROC nationality** and PhD track; not eligible. ([TSMC][26])
* **GovAI DC Summer Fellowship 2026** — requires **US right-to-work** and explicitly **no visa sponsorship** (unless you already have authorization). ([GovAI][7])
* **Anthropic Fellows Program 2026** — requires being located in **US/UK/Canada** with **work authorization** and they **don’t sponsor visas** (unless you already have authorization). ([Greenhouse][28])
* **Google PhD Fellowship** — PhD fellowship; master’s not eligible. ([Google Research][15])
* **Apple Scholars in AI/ML** — explicitly a **PhD fellowship** program. ([Apple Machine Learning Research][18])
* **Microsoft Research Fellowship (global)** — explicitly requires actively pursuing a **PhD**. ([Microsoft][17])
* **潘文淵–考察研究獎助金** — requires **domestic PhD + employed in Taiwan**; not for master’s. ([ctld.ncku.edu.tw][24])

## Quick “fit notes” specific to your 國科會 RA constraint

* **Non‑Taiwan-government funders** (LTFF, Alignment Project, CTCI) are **not automatically disqualified** by “no Taiwan gov stipend” rules, but you should still check:

  * whether your NSTC-funded **學習型研究獎助生** contract restricts external paid work or overlapping stipends,
  * whether “獎學金不可兼領” language in a private scholarship treats RA stipend as a scholarship (often it does **not**, but confirm).

---

If you want the **next pass**, tell me which direction is higher priority and I’ll only return items with **official pages + explicit deadlines**:

1. “Finish the org list” (SERI / Conjecture / Redwood / ARC / CAIS / Open Phil individual programs), or
2. “Malaysia focus” (FAATUM + state Chinese assembly halls + Khazanah/BNM/Petronas), or
3. “Taiwan private scholarships” (Delta / MediaTek (general) / other foundations accepting 境外生).
