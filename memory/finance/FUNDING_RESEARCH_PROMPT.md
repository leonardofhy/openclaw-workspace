2. **MATS (ML Alignment Theory Scholars)** — matsprogram.org — 2026 cohort schedule, stipend, location requirement
3. **LTFF (Long-Term Future Fund)** — funds.effectivealtruism.org — rolling grants for AI safety research. What's a realistic grant size for a master's student? What do successful applications look like?
4. **Open Philanthropy** — Any individual researcher grants or early-career programs?

1. **MOE Taiwan Scholarship** — Can currently-enrolled master's students apply? Or only new admissions? Deadline is Feb 1 - Apr 30, 2026
2. **MARA GrEP (Graduate Excellence Programme)** — Is this Bumiputera-only or can Chinese Malaysians apply?
3. **留台聯總 (FAATUM)** — Any postgraduate scholarships? faatum.com.my

5. **馬來西亞華教基金會 (Dong Jiao Zong)** — Any postgraduate funding?

#### Category 4: Taiwan-specific (non-government, won't conflict with 研究獎助生)

1. **中技社境外生研究獎學金** — Verify 2026 timeline (historically July-Sept)
2. **潘文淵獎學金** — Verify master's eligibility requirements, NTU-specific rules
3. **台達電子文教基金會 (Delta Electronics Foundation)** — Any student scholarships?
4. **台積電 TSMC 獎學金** — EE/CS master's students?
5. **聯發科 MediaTek 獎學金** — Signal processing / AI?

### Output Format

Please organize as a table for each category:

| Opportunity | Amount | Deadline | Eligibility Match | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then at the end, give me:
1. **TOP 5 highest-ROI opportunities** (considering amount × probability × effort)
2. **Urgent actions** (deadlines within 30 days)
3. **Anything I should NOT apply for** (waste of time given my profile)

Be honest about uncertainty — if you can't verify a deadline, say so. I'd rather have accurate info on 15 opportunities than unverified info on 30.
