# Project: Income / Cashflow (Leo)

## North Star
- Extend runway with **minimal time cost** while keeping research priority.

## Current constraints (2026-02-19)
- Time-to-cash: within **2 months**
- Time budget: **~5h/week**
- Preferred: consulting/freelance + fixed monthly retainer
- Avoid as primary short-term path: big-tech LeetCode/math-heavy pipeline
- Compliance: Taiwan part-time work permit requirements **uncertain** → treat as risk; prefer remote/consulting until confirmed.

1) **RAG/LLM System Audit (2h)** → issue list + remediation roadmap
2) **Eval/Benchmark Harness (5–10h)** → reproducible eval scripts + metrics/report template
3) **Data Pipeline Quality Spec (5–10h)** → quality checklist + ETL plan + sample scripts

## Target monthly income (draft)
