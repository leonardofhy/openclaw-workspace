# Income strategy reference (Leo) — 2026-02-19

## Context / constraints
- Goal: start earning **within 2 months**.
- Time budget: **~5 hours/week** for income generation (research remains priority).
- Preferred modes: **consulting / freelance** and/or a **fixed part-time retainer** (not full internship).
- Taiwan company internship: perceived low marginal value given ~2 years work experience.
- Big-tech interviews: heavy LeetCode/math pipeline is painful; avoid as primary short-term path.
- Work eligibility: **uncertain** whether a work permit is needed for part-time work in Taiwan; treat as a compliance risk.

## Recommended strategy (high-level)
### Two-track approach (risk-controlled)
1) **Track A (safe/fast cash): remote consulting / small contracts**
   - Productize into small, high-clarity deliverables.
   - Minimize reliance on Taiwan employment relationships until eligibility is confirmed.

2) **Track B (stable): fixed monthly retainer (part-time consulting)**
   - Target: 20h/month retainer (≈5h/week).
   - Use a scope like “LLM eval/infra advisor” rather than “general SWE intern”.

## What Leo can sell (evidence from resume)
- LLM training at scale (DeepSpeed, Lightning, PEFT; V100/H100 clusters)
- Data pipeline / ETL (20TB → curated corpora)
- Evaluation platform / CI benchmarks (10+ benchmarks)
- RAG systems for finance + custom parsers
- DevOps + performance optimization (latency 20s → <5s; Docker/CI/CD; many PRs)

## Consulting offers (packaged)
1) **RAG/LLM System Audit (2 hours)**
   - Output: prioritized issue list + 2-week remediation roadmap.

2) **Eval / Benchmark Harness Setup (5–10 hours)**
   - Output: reproducible scripts + metrics definition + report template.

3) **Data Pipeline Quality Spec + Cleaning Plan (5–10 hours)**
   - Output: data quality checklist + ETL steps + sample scripts.

## Next steps (minimal action, 7 days)
- Define a one-line positioning.
- List 10–15 warm leads (ex-colleagues, lab/startup circles, AI safety network).
- Send a short message offering 30min scoping call + the 3 packaged services.
- Convert any interest into a written scope + quote.

## Notes
- Once eligibility is confirmed, expand to Taiwan-based retainer options.
