# 🧠 Cycle #66 — 2026-02-28 08:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Morning cron trigger (meta-awareness label). arXiv Feb 28 batch not yet posted (~14:00 Taipei). Meta-audit saturation declared cycle #63 (30 min ago). Execution-blocked since cycle #42. Unblock-request.md PENDING since 02:01 AM (~6.5h). Meta-board 6/6 Qs answered. Morning relay rule active (06:00-09:00 window).

### Meta-Awareness State Check (30-second scan)

**System health:** Stable. All 6 meta-improvements from overnight active:
1. ✅ Skip-guard (2 consecutive skips → force meta-audit)
2. ✅ Experiment-queue.md created (6 experiments, P1-P6, with prerequisites)
3. ✅ Cron audit complete (dead job flagged: `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting`)
4. ✅ 3-line report format applied
5. ✅ Unblock-request.md protocol in place
6. ✅ Synthesis threshold rule (≥10 reads without experiment → force reflect-synthesis)

**New meta-awareness question for this cycle:**
> Q8: Paper pitches were created (paper-a-pitch.md, paper-b-pitch.md at 04:01-04:31 AM) but Leo hasn't seen them yet. Are they in the morning handoff path?

**Answer & micro-improvement applied:**
The pitches are files but not referenced from the unblock-request.md or any relay mechanism. Adding a pointer now — this is the only high-value meta-fix remaining.

### Morning Relay (per meta-board rule)

⭐ **UNBLOCK-REQUEST PENDING** (since 02:01 AM, ~6.5 hours)
Leo needs ~15 min to unblock all 6 experiments. See `memory/learning/unblock-request.md`.

**Also ready for Leo review (created overnight):**
- 📄 `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md` — "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs" (1-page pitch, abstract draft, 4-experiment table, venue comparison)
- 📄 `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` — "AudioSAEBench" (5-category benchmark, `gc(F)` metric, MVP scope)

These are the first reviewable research documents Leo hasn't seen yet.

### What's New Since Leo's Last Session

Overnight (02:00–08:00 AM) activity:
- Cycles #50-65 = 12 meta cycles, 3 skips, 1 citation scan
- **6 system improvements** applied (listed above)
- **2 paper pitches** written (Paper A + B, 1-page each, ready to review)
- **arXiv Feb 28**: same top-3 papers as cycle #60, no new submissions before 14:00 Taipei
- **Field status unchanged**: zero papers do layer-wise causal audio patching → Leo's gap still open

## Next

arXiv Feb 28 batch at ~14:00 Taipei → next learn cycle. Until then, this is last meta cycle — await Leo unblock.
