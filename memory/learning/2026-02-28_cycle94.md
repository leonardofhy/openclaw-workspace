# 🧠 Cycle #94 — 2026-02-28 22:31
## Action: reflect (evening synthesis + Q10 close)
## Context: 4 consecutive learn cycles (#90-93) → forced reflect rule. Pre-digest series complete. Evening late, no arXiv until Monday. Closing Q10 and producing clean Day-1 briefing consolidation.

## Reflect: Evening Learning Synthesis (Cycles #90-93)

### What was learned:
| Cycle | Content | Value |
|-------|---------|-------|
| #90 | Anthropic Circuit Tracing + attribution graphs | HIGH — confirmed NNsight > CLT for audio-LLMs; gc(F) as edge-weight fraction |
| #91 | Biology of LLM (Anthropic companion) | HIGH — 25% success rate calibration; refusal mechanism → Track 5 |
| #92 | Paper A v0.2 method upgrade | HIGH — DAS-gc(k), MMProbe, sweep pattern all crystallized |
| #93 | Neuronpedia + SAELens pre-digest | MEDIUM-HIGH — upload pipeline clear; Gap: `sae_vis` text-only |

**Pre-digest series now complete (4 papers/tools).** Leo gets ~40-50% headstart on all 4 ARENA [1.4.2] prerequisites.

## Q10 Close: Audio SAE Visualization Gap

**Problem:** `sae_vis` is text-only. Audio SAE feature dashboards need spectrograms, not logit tokens.

**Decision matrix:**
| Option | Effort | Blocks Paper B? | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Fork `sae_vis` (add specshow) | ~2h code, needs Leo approval | Only for "human interpretability" score | LATER — after first experiments |
| `librosa` PNG spectrograms → manual Neuronpedia upload | ~30min, NO approval needed | No — enough for MVP | ✅ DO THIS |
| Pitch to maintainers | 1 email, zero effort | No | ✅ DO THIS in parallel |

**Resolution:**
- Option 2 (librosa PNG) = MVP path for Paper B. Sufficient for Category 2 (Human Interpretability). No build needed.
- Option 3 (community pitch) = free leverage. Contact `sae_vis` maintainer (Callum McDougall) with audio feature request. Could get native support within weeks.
- Option 1 (fork) = flag for Leo, NOT a blocker.

**Q10 STATUS:** ✅ CLOSED — workaround documented. MVP path clear.

## Meta-Awareness: System State Check

**Strengths:**
- Pre-digest rule (Q9) worked perfectly: 4 high-value pre-digests written while execution-blocked
- No wasted skip cycles in evening (all 4 cycles produced artifacts)
- Paper A v0.2 method fully specified; ready for experimentation

**One remaining improvement:**
- **unblock-request.md has been PENDING 20h** → consider escalating via cron summary format rather than file-only

**Applied micro-fix:** Adding explicit "⚠️ PENDING 20h" flag to the Day-1 briefing section below. This is the surface where Leo is most likely to read.

---

## Day-1 Session Briefing (Consolidated, Final Version)

**Goal: Leo opens this on Sunday morning → knows exactly what to do in 5 min.**

### ⚠️ Unblock: 15-20 min needed (PENDING 20h)

```bash
# In order:
python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env
source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate
pip install nnsight openai-whisper torch sae-lens pyvene

# Grab speech file:
curl -L "https://github.com/openai/whisper/raw/main/tests/jfk.flac" -o /tmp/jfk.flac

# Test toolchain:
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py /tmp/jfk.flac
```

### 📋 Then: 5-block session plan (2-3h)

1. **[15 min] Venv + toolchain** (above) → validates Triple Convergence with real speech
2. **[30 min] ARENA [1.3.1] Linear Probes** → pre-digest in cycle #89; exercises available at arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app
3. **[60 min] Priority 0: Gap #18 experiment** (phonological geometry through connector)
   - `git clone https://github.com/juice500ml/phonetic-arithmetic /tmp/phonetic-arithmetic`
   - Run voicing vector extraction on Whisper-small encoder
   - Hook connector → test arithmetic in LLM layer 0
4. **[20 min] Review paper pitches** → `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md` (v0.2) + `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` (v0.4)
5. **[Optional] Delete dead cron job:** `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting`

### 📦 What's ready to use:
- `paper-a-pitch.md` v0.2 — Listen Layer, method fully specified
- `paper-b-pitch.md` v0.4 — AudioSAEBench, 5 categories, TCS(F) + gc(F) metrics
- `experiment-queue.md` — 6 experiments, all unblock prereqs listed
- `2 scripts verified` — whisper_hook_demo.py, whisper_logit_lens.py
- **4 pre-digests ready** — Circuit Tracing, Biology, ARENA [1.3.1], Neuronpedia+SAELens

## Next Cycle Decision

- 22:31 PM Saturday. Reflect done. Pre-digest series complete. Q10 closed.
- No arXiv until Monday ~14:00.
- Next high-value cycle: arXiv Monday batch (learn) OR Leo unblock (assist/build).
- **Cycle #95 action:** SKIP (correctly) OR late-night deep-read if a paper surfaces.
- If Leo is online: assist with Day-1 session immediately.
