# 🧠 Cycle #7 — 2026-02-26 17:00
## Action: learn
## Context: Cycle #6 recommended AudioLens as the next deep-read. This is 智凱哥's lab paper (NTU 李宏毅 lab), directly relevant to Track 3 (Listen vs Guess), and Leo has a collaboration advantage. AudioMatters CMT deadline is at 19:00 — still 2 hours away, no active work needed here. High-value action confirmed.

## Content: Deep-read "AudioLens" (Yang et al., 2025, ASRU)
**Paper:** A Closer Look at Auditory Attribute Perception of Large Audio-Language Models  
**arXiv:** 2506.05140v2 | Accepted ASRU 2025  
**Authors:** Neo Ho, Yi-Jyun Lee, Hung-yi Lee (NTU) — **智凱哥 = Chih-Kai Yang (ckyang1124)**

### Problem
- LALMs analyzed at task-level (benchmarks), but internal mechanism = unknown
- Existing work only covers high-level behaviors (biases, hallucinations) without probing representations
- First study of *how LALMs internally process auditory attributes*

### Method
**Core tool:** Logit Lens (training-free vocabulary projection)
- Project intermediate hidden states h_i^ℓ through unembedding matrix W_U → probability dist over vocab
- "Layer-wise Information Score" I_i^ℓ = accuracy of predicting attribute label from layer ℓ, position i
- "Critical Layer" ℓ_i* = weighted average of layer indices (weighted by contribution above chance+threshold)
  - α=0.2, threshold = (1+α)/|Y|; filters near-chance layers

**Models tested:** DeSTA2, Qwen-Audio, Qwen2-Audio  
**Attributes:** speaker gender, spoken language, speaker emotion, animal  
**Dataset:** SAKURA benchmark (500 samples/attribute; 2, 8, 5, 9 labels respectively)  
**Prompts:** 3 formats — Direct (P1), QA (P2), MC (P3)  
**Token focus:** Last token position ("is" in "The speaker's gender is ___")

### Key Findings

**RQ1: Attribute evolution across layers**
- Information scores increase with depth but NOT monotonically
- Sharp drops then recoveries are common (some recoveries fail)
- Gender has a characteristic concentrated pattern in mid-to-late layers in Qwen/Qwen2
- Failed recognition = information peaks mid-layer then decreases; success = rises with depth

**RQ2: Success vs. failure dynamics**
- Two opposing dynamics: success → info rises monotonically; failure → info peaks midway then drops
- This is a clean diagnostic signature: mid-layer peak + drop = failure mode

**RQ3: Critical layer vs. accuracy**
- Negative correlation: earlier resolution layer → higher accuracy
- Why: earlier resolution leaves more subsequent layers to *refine* the representation
- Implication: if a model resolves "gender" at layer 10/32, it has 22 layers to polish → better performance

**RQ4: Token position information flow**
- LALMs **heavily rely on querying auditory inputs directly** rather than aggregating info at text positions
- Even when attributes are "mentioned" earlier in the prompt, those text positions are insufficient
- This explains why LALMs struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks
- Key metaphor: models "look back" at audio tokens for prediction, not "remember" them in text context

**RQ5: Improvement method**
- Enrich deeper-layer representations with earlier attribute-rich representations
- No training required
- **+16.3% relative improvement** in prediction accuracy

### Connections to Leo's Research Goals

**Direct link to Track 3 (Listen vs Guess):**
- "LALMs rely on querying audio inputs directly" = empirical evidence for the "Listen vs Guess" hypothesis
- AudioLens uses Logit Lens; Leo's work could extend this with *causal* patching to *quantify* the grounding coefficient
- AudioLens finding → operationalize: patching sensitivity to audio tokens vs. text tokens = grounding coefficient

**Critical layer concept:**
- "Saturation layer" in Beyond Transcription (cycle #6) ≈ "Critical Layer" in AudioLens — both identify where attributes resolve
- Cross-paper connection: Glazer's encoder saturation layer ↔ Yang's critical layer in LALM decoder
- Combined: can we build a unified "resolution layer" analysis across encoder (Whisper) and decoder (LALM)?

**Gap AudioLens doesn't fill:**
1. Only uses Logit Lens (no causal patching) — cannot distinguish "the model encodes it" from "the model actually USES it"
2. No intervention experiments — we don't know if the grounding relationship is causal
3. No cross-model comparison of grounding coefficients
4. Dataset: SAKURA (simple attributes) — doesn't test complex reasoning or phonetic/prosodic tasks

**These gaps = Leo's research opportunity:**
- AudioLens + patching → "We extend AudioLens by introducing causal interventions to verify grounding causally"
- Define: grounding_coefficient = (Δ accuracy when audio patched) / (Δ accuracy when text patched)
- 🚀 This is a concrete, testable extension of AudioLens that adds causal validity

### Open Questions
1. Does the "critical layer" shift when the model is hallucinating vs. correctly recognizing?
2. Is the "querying audio directly" pattern consistent for *phonetic* attributes (phoneme identity, accent) vs. semantic (language ID)?
3. Can we reproduce AudioLens results on a local model (DeSTA2 is smaller) as a starter experiment?
4. Does the +16.3% improvement method transfer to ASR (WER reduction)?

## Next: 
Cycle #8 options:
1. **AudioSAE** (arXiv:2602.05027) — fills the SAE dimension gap
2. **Activation Patching Best Practices** (Heimersheim & Nanda) — needed before patching experiments
3. **SPIRIT** (audio safety) — fill safety track knowledge
→ **Recommend:** AudioSAE (#8) since SAE is foundational for Track 2 and evaluating grounding mechanistically
