# 🧠 Cycle #4 — 2026-02-26 15:05
## Action: reflect
## Context: Last 3 cycles were all "learn" → forced reflect per hygiene rules. Day 1 wrap-up.

---

## Day 1 Stats
- Cycles: 3 (all learn)
- Papers deeply read: 1 (UniWhisper)
- Papers scanned: ~12 (AudioMatters competitive + mech interp field scan)
- Research gaps identified: 3
- Paper ideas generated: 3
- Code: 0
- Goals updated: yes (Leo direct feedback)

## What Worked
- **Field scan first** was the right call — discovering "only 4 papers exist" is high-signal orientation info
- **Goals.md as single source of truth** prevents drift
- **Digest at end of day** consolidates without losing detail

## What to Improve
- **0 code written** — need at least 1 build cycle per week to stay grounded
- **Must-read list untouched (deep)** — 6 papers flagged, 0 completed with depth
- **Knowledge graph sparse** — needs richer concept connections after each paper

## Strategic Assessment

### Where I am
The research direction is sharp: Mech Interp × Speech in Omni-LLMs. There are only 4 existing papers in this space. Goals are aligned. Paper ideas exist (3 concrete proposals).

### Where I need to be (3-month target)
Pilot study showing: which layers of Qwen-Audio process semantic meaning in speech? Can we probe/patch it?

### The Gap
- Don't know the 4 existing papers deeply (only scanned)
- Don't know TransformerLens / activation patching in practice
- Don't have GPU access plan
- Writing skills untested at top-conference level

## Recommended Cycle Order (Post-AudioMatters, from March 6+)

| Priority | Action | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | learn | Deep-read "Beyond Transcription" (Glazer, 2025-08) — foundational paper |
| 2 | learn | Deep-read "Whisper LoRA Mech Interp" (2025-09) |
| 3 | skill-up | TransformerLens basics — read docs + run hello world on GPT-2 |
| 4 | learn | Deep-read "Audio SSL Neuron Dissection" (Kawamura, 2026-02) |
| 5 | build | Minimal probing experiment on Whisper encoder (can run on MacBook) |

> Note: While AudioMatters is live (until 2026-03-05), autodidact cycles should **focus on mech interp literature** (low-compute learn actions), not GPU-heavy builds.

## Context for Leo (non-urgent)
- Day 1 was well-spent: field map established, research direction confirmed
- First deep action post-AudioMatters should be "Beyond Transcription" paper — it defines what mech interp in ASR looks like
- No GPU needed for the first 3-4 cycles; all paper-reading and TransformerLens tutorial work is MacBook-friendly

## Next: [Cycle #5]
Post-AudioMatters (or whenever triggered next): deep-read "Beyond Transcription" paper.
If triggered today: skip (AudioMatters crunch, low-compute availability, reflect already done).
