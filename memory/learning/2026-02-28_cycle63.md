# 🧠 Cycle #63 — 2026-02-28 07:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Morning cycle. Execution-blocked since cycle #42 (~15h). Leo waking up. arXiv Feb 28 batch arrives ~14:00. Last relay cycle was #62 (06:31). All meta-board questions answered. Checking system state before arXiv batch arrives.

### System State Check

**Research execution status:**
- Blocked since cycle #42 (2026-02-27 16:01) — ~15h
- Unblock request PENDING since 02:01 AM (5h)
- 4 overnight meta-cycles (#50–55) produced genuine value: 6 system improvements, 2 paper pitches, experiment queue
- Now in "waiting mode" — correctly not generating noise while awaiting Leo unblock

**Meta-board final check:**
- All 6/6 Q&A answered ✅
- Week 9 KPIs recorded ✅
- Week 10 targets set (skip_ratio ≤40%, novelty_ratio ≥65%) ✅
- Morning relay rule active ✅
- Skip guard active (3-skip → unblock-request) ✅

**Paper pitch status (both ready for Leo):**
- Paper A ("Listen Layer"): v0.1 complete — abstract, 3-phase method, 4 experiments, venue table ✅
- Paper B ("AudioSAEBench"): v0.1 complete — 5-category protocol, Grounding Sensitivity metric, MVP scope ✅
- Both pitches share: ALME stimuli, gc metric, NNsight toolchain, Triple Convergence theory

### Meta-Assessment: Is the System Over-Indexed on Meta?

**Honest count:**
- Cycles #50–62: 12 cycles of meta/skip/relay
- Cycles #24–41: 18 cycles of genuine learning and synthesis
- Ratio: 40% meta overhead this session

**Assessment:** Meta overhead peaked at the right time (after queue depletion). System self-corrected via meta-board. The overnight meta work was high-value (produced 2 paper pitches + 6 system improvements). But further meta cycles now yield diminishing returns.

**Decision:** This is the LAST meta-only cycle until arXiv Feb 28 batch arrives or Leo unblocks. If neither happens by cycle #65 (08:01), write one final morning report and pause.

### One New Observation: Paper A Timing Risk

Looking at the goals.md Key Deadlines table:
- Interspeech 2026: PDF 2026-03-05 ← **5 days away**
- AudioMatters just submitted there

Wait — AudioMatters was already submitted to Interspeech 2026 (March 5 deadline). If Paper A targets NeurIPS 2026, that's safer. But if Leo wanted Interspeech 2026 for Paper A... the timeline is impossible (experiments haven't started yet).

**Clarification for Leo:** Paper A should target **NeurIPS 2026** (May deadline) or **Interspeech 2026 workshop** — NOT the March 5 main track. The pitch already says NeurIPS 2026 as primary. This is correct. No action needed, just confirming reasoning.

## Next

- arXiv Feb 28 batch at ~14:00 Taipei → next learn cycle
- Leo unblock → begin E1 (Whisper-small IIT sweep, ~3h, MacBook)
- No more meta cycles until external novelty arrives or Leo provides feedback
