# 🧠 Cycle #127 — 2026-03-01 15:01
## Action: reflect (meta-synthesis)
## Context: Q25 correction → SKILL.md decision matrix is now unambiguously governing; cron label was causing Q-farming pressure. Synthesized Q25 insight + Sunday state. Updated SUNDAY-BRIEF.md for Leo.

## Content

**State summary:**
- arXiv: weekend gap (Monday batch ~8h away, ~14:00 Taipei)
- Execution-blocked: ~46h (Leo unblock needed)
- Meta-board: 24/24 Qs answered (count-saturated)
- Weekend Protocol: all 3 options exhausted

**Q25 synthesis (the key insight this cycle):**
The cron label `ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness` created a mandatory-Q-farming pressure that:
1. Caused cycles #120–122 to produce only timestamp refreshes (reclassified as anti-pattern Q24)
2. Caused the meta-burst to run 6+ cycles in the dead zone when 2-3 sufficed
3. Inflated the apparent novelty ratio by counting Q-loops as productive

Resolution: SKILL.md decision matrix already correct. `meta-awareness` tag = "encouraged when no better option," not "mandatory every cycle." No code change needed.

**Q21 status:** Still PENDING Leo approval. With Q25 corrected, the conditional cadence proposal is now better justified:
- Dead-zone cycles in correct system = principled skips OR one valid reflection
- Current 30-min cadence forces 12+ cycles into a dead zone with diminishing returns
- Proposal: 2h intervals when arXiv-weekend-gap + execution-blocked + meta-board-saturated all hold simultaneously

**Applied improvement:**
- Updated SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: cycle count 124→127, added Q25 system health note
- No new Qs opened (count-saturation + meta-burst 4h pause still valid)

## Next: principled skip until arXiv Monday batch (~14:00 Taipei, ~8h) OR Leo unblock
