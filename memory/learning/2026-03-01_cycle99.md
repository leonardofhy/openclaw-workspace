# 🧠 Cycle #99 — 2026-03-01 01:01
## Action: learn (citation trail — Weekend Protocol option A)
## Context: Weekend gap (arXiv ~38h away). Execution-blocked. Meta-board saturated. Cycle #98 did (c) pre-flight doc. Per Weekend Protocol rule (Q11), option (a) = citation trail is valid non-skip action. Chose to trace AudioLens (arXiv:2506.05140) citations on Semantic Scholar.

## Content

**AudioLens citation trail (Semantic Scholar):**
5 papers found citing AudioLens. 2 already deep-read (Cascade Equivalence 2602.17598, Zhao et al. ESNs 2601.03115, Sound Symbolism 2511.10045 = scanned).

**2 NEW papers found — both from Hung-yi Lee lab (NTU), same as AudioLens:**

### 1. SAKE (arXiv:2510.16917) — "Towards Editing Auditory Attribute Knowledge of LALMs"
- **What**: First benchmark for knowledge editing in LALMs (auditory attribute knowledge)
- **Scope**: 7 editing methods × 2 LALMs × 4 dimensions (reliability, generality, audio/text locality, portability)
- **Key**: Targets abstract auditory attributes (not just factual text); evaluates edit generalization to multimodal reasoning
- **Status**: "Work in progress" (Oct 2025)
- **Relevance to Leo**: MODERATE — editing ≠ patching; but "audio/text locality" dimension is adjacent to Track 3 grounding_coefficient (does the edit affect audio representations or text representations differently?)
- **Gap confirmed**: No mechanistic analysis of WHY edits fail (behavioral benchmark only, no causal patching) → potential Track 3 extension: mechanistic grounding of editing failures
- **Action**: SCAN — not a competitor; may cite in Paper A related work (knowledge editing ≠ causal tracing)

### 2. Safety Vulnerabilities under Emotional Variation (arXiv:2510.16893) — Feng et al., ICASSP 2026
- **What**: LALMs' safety alignment breaks under speaker emotion variation
- **Key findings**: Different emotions → different unsafe response rates; medium intensity = highest risk (non-monotonic)
- **Relevance to Leo**: HIGH for Track 5 (Safety Mechanistic Defenses)
  - Gap: No mechanistic explanation of WHY emotion breaks safety alignment
  - Question: Which layers/heads allow emotion to override safety? → activation patching + SPIRIT-style defense
  - Connects: SPIRIT (cycle #13, 100% ASR→~1%) + Zhao et al. ESNs + Gap #18 connector test
  - New framing: "Emotion-modulated safety" = safety neurons that SPIRIT patches could have emotion sensitivity as a confound
- **Status**: ICASSP 2026 accepted
- **Action**: SCAN — cite in Track 5 paper. Key gap = mechanistic cause of emotion-safety interaction

## New Gap (candidate)
**Gap #20 (tentative)**: Why does speaker emotion override LALM safety alignment? Behavioral evidence (Feng et al.) confirms the effect; mechanistic cause unknown. Hypothesis: safety-relevant features in LLM residual stream are modulated by emotion features from audio encoder. Test: SPIRIT-style patching on emotion-varied stimuli → track feature overlap between emotion neurons (Zhao et al.) and safety neurons.

**Idea gate status**: GATE PENDING — needs full gate run before adding to goals.md.

## T-SAE citation trail (arXiv:2511.05541)
- Semantic Scholar: 0 citations (expected — ICLR Oral paper, just camera-ready Feb 25)
- Gap #17 (audio T-SAE) still confirmed OPEN with no approaching competitors

## Assessment
- Cycle value: MEDIUM-HIGH — 2 new papers found from the NTU/Hung-yi Lee group; Gap #20 candidate identified
- Notable: AudioLens is from Leo's advisor's lab; both SAKE + Feng et al. are from the same lab cluster (Yun-Nung Chen + Hung-yi Lee + Szu-Wei Fu + Ke-Han Lu overlap). This lab cluster is prolific in LALM safety + editing space but NOT doing causal MI patching — Leo's gap remains open.
- Weekend Protocol: option (a) citation trail ✅ DONE. Options (b) foundational paper and (c) pre-flight doc partially covered by cycles #90-93 and #98. System not idle.

## Next: 
Cycle #100 = milestone reflection OR citation trail of FCCT (arXiv:2504.xxxx — need correct ID) to monitor competition.
