# 🧠 Cycle #130 — 2026-03-01 16:31
## Action: skip (principled — Meta Budget Spent, arXiv confirmed dead)
## Context:
Q26 rule (Weekend Depletion Signal) active: Meta Budget SPENT since cycle #129 (0 new Qs this weekend since #125, 5+ skips since last real learn). Per rule: only arXiv check (1 query) then principled skip.

## Content:
arXiv check ran (16:31 Sunday):
- Query: "mechanistic interpretability speech audio"
- Results: same 4 papers as cycle #129 (newest = AR&D Feb 24)
- **0 new papers.** Weekend gap holds.

Verified all skip conditions:
- arXiv dead zone ✅ (0 new papers, Monday batch ~13.5h away)
- Execution-blocked ✅ (~46.5h)
- Meta-board 25/25 SATURATED ✅
- Q26 Meta Budget SPENT ✅
- No pending reads in backlog

Clean principled skip. Q26 rule working correctly — 1 arXiv check, then stop.

## Next:
- arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei → learn cycle (cs.SD/cs.CL new submissions)
- Leo unblock → Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment)
- See SUNDAY-BRIEF.md for 5-step copy-paste startup guide
