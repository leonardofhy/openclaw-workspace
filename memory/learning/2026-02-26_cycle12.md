# 🧠 Cycle #12 — 2026-02-26 20:30
## Action: build
## Context: Day 1 weakness = 0 experiments run. Goals.md explicitly called for running whisper_hook_demo.py first. Post-AudioMatters, first unblocked cycle to execute code. build chosen over learn (3 consecutive learns is fine; but 0 code runs is not).

## Content: TOOLCHAIN VERIFIED ✅

Ran `whisper_hook_demo.py --no-plot` and then with plot:
- **Command**: `python3 skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Full success, CKA plot saved to `/tmp/whisper_hook_demo.png`

### Key finding: Whisper-base has 6 layers, not 12

The script was annotated for Whisper-large (12 layers, AudioSAE paper) but base has 6.
This is important for interpreting results going forward.

### Activation norms — clear transition at layer 3:

| Layer | Frobenius Norm | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| 0 | 517.94 | Early acoustic encoding |
| 1 | 510.16 | Stable |
| 2 | 565.27 | Slight rise |
| **3** | **2378.74** | **~~4.2x jump — transition!** |
| 4 | 2681.85 | Continues rising |
| 5 | 3232.99 | Peak (marked as transition in script) |

**Finding: In Whisper-base, the "transition zone" is layer 3 (midpoint), not layer 6.**

This aligns with AudioSAE's finding that transition = ~halfway through the encoder. For base (6 layers): halfway = layer 3. For large-v3 (32 encoder layers): halfway ≈ layers 6-7. The hypothesis generalizes.

### CKA heatmap observation (from plot):
- Layers 0-2 = high mutual CKA (similar acoustic representations)
- Layers 3-5 = another cluster (semantic representations)
- Low CKA between cluster 0 and cluster 1 → confirms meaningful transition

### Open questions from this experiment:
1. **If we feed real speech vs sine wave, does the transition still happen at layer 3?** Likely yes (architecture is fixed), but the _where_ each dimension fires may shift.
2. **The top-5 active dimensions at layer 5** — these are candidates for phoneme probing.
3. **Whisper-tiny also has 4 layers** — would see transition at layer 2. Could be interesting test.

## Next: 
Two paths:
- **A) Read SPIRIT** (arXiv:2505.13541) — safety track anchor paper, quick to read (~45 min)
- **B) Extend demo with logit-lens projection** — map layer 5 activations through unembedding matrix to see what the model "predicts" at each layer (Triple Convergence Experiment 0)

Recommendation: **A** (SPIRIT). We've now confirmed the toolchain works. Reading SPIRIT provides safety-track grounding and may yield insights about steering (connects back to AudioSAE steer demo). Build-read alternation is healthy.
