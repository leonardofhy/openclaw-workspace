# 🧠 Cycle #100 — 2026-03-01 01:31
## Action: reflect (milestone synthesis + Gap #20 idea gate)
## Context: Milestone cycle. Cycle #99 = citation trail found Gap #20 candidate (emotion-modulated safety). Weekend Protocol in effect (arXiv gap ~36h). Options (a) ✅ + (c) ✅ used. This cycle = milestone reflect + inline Gate on Gap #20.

## 🎯 Milestone Snapshot: Cycles 1-100

**Started:** 2026-02-26 14:22 AM
**Elapsed:** ~3 days, 11 hours
**Cycles:** 100 total

### Cumulative Stats
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Papers deep-read | 16 |
| Papers scanned | 33+ |
| Research gaps identified | 19 (+ Gap #20 candidate) |
| Paper ideas | 7 (all gate-validated 🟢) |
| Code written | 2 scripts (verified ✅) |
| Cheat sheets | 1 (NNsight + SAELens) |
| Experiment proposals | 3 |
| Paper pitches | 2 (A v0.2 + B v0.4) |
| ARENA pre-digests | 4 |
| Meta-board Qs answered | 13/13 |
| System improvements applied | 6 |
| Cron jobs audited | 27 |

### Action Distribution (100 cycles)
- learn: ~35 cycles
- skip: ~30 cycles (most justified, Weekend Protocol now prevents pure idle)
- reflect: ~20 cycles (incl. meta-awareness)
- plan: ~6 cycles
- build/skill-up/report: ~9 cycles

### Quality Assessment
- **High value (produced artifact or genuine insight):** ~62 cycles → novelty_ratio = 62% (target: ≥65%)
- **Justified skip:** ~28 cycles (execution-blocked, arXiv dry)
- **Wasted:** ~10 cycles (early meta-board saturation before Weekend Protocol rule)
- **System improved after:** Weekend Protocol rule now prevents 10+ wasted cycles per weekend

### What's Been Built
1. Full field map: speech MI has ~20 papers, Leo owns the **causal patching** gap
2. Triple Convergence Hypothesis: layers 6-7 (50% depth) = acoustic→semantic transition zone, confirmed by 4 methods
3. "Listen Layer Hypothesis": small set of LLM layers/heads = where audio causally consulted vs text
4. Grounding coefficient `gc(k)`: formally grounded in IIT theory (DAS, pyvene)
5. Paper A pitch v0.2: "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs" — fully specified method
6. Paper B pitch v0.4: "AudioSAEBench" — 5-category + 2 novel metrics (gc(F), TCS(F))
7. Audio T-SAE (Idea #7): Temporal SAE for speech — gate-validated 🟢, venue: Interspeech 2027
8. Gap #18: Phonological vector geometry through connector — Priority 0 experiment
9. Gap #19: No standardized audio SAE training pipeline in SAELens ecosystem
10. Day-1 unblock session plan: 5 blocks, 2-3h, ready for Leo

## 🔬 Inline Idea Gate: Gap #20

**Claim:** Speaker emotion modulates LALM safety alignment non-monotonically (Feng et al. 2510.16893, ICASSP 2026). Mechanistic cause unknown.

**Proposed idea:** "Emotion-Modulated Safety Patching" — use SPIRIT-style activation patching on emotion-varied stimuli; cross-reference with Zhao et al. emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs); identify which layers/heads allow emotion to override safety.

### Gate Queries (5 angles)
1. **"emotion speech safety mechanistic interpretability"** → only SPIRIT (blind layer patching); Feng et al. (behavioral only); 0 papers do feature-level causal explanation
2. **"emotion override safety alignment audio"** → Feng et al. 2510.16893 is the only behavioral paper; no mechanistic follow-up
3. **"emotion sensitive neurons safety vulnerability"** → Zhao et al. ESNs (cycle #25) are in LALMs; SPIRIT patches layers blindly; cross-reference = untested
4. **"audio jailbreak feature attribution"** → SPIRIT 2505.13541 + Feng et al. = state of art. Zero SAE-guided feature attribution for audio safety.
5. **"speaker emotion safety alignment robustness"** → Feng et al. only. Field = empty.

### Gate Assessment
- **Novelty:** 🟢 HIGH — 0 mechanistic papers on emotion-safety interaction in LALMs
- **Feasibility:** 🟡 MEDIUM — requires GPU (Qwen2-Audio), Feng et al. dataset (not yet public), SPIRIT codebase (public), Zhao et al. stimuli (reconstructable)
- **Strategic fit:** 🟡 MEDIUM — Track 5 (Safety) is lowest priority in 5-track portfolio; adds 3rd paper to pitching load; safety = harder venues for speech
- **Risk:** Medium — Feng et al. are from Hung-yi Lee lab (same as AudioLens) and may be actively working on mechanistic follow-up
- **Leo infrastructure reuse:** HIGH — SPIRIT patching + NNsight + Whisper stack all already set up

### Gate Verdict: 🟡 YELLOW
**Reason:** Genuine gap, good novelty, but:
1. Track 5 = lowest portfolio priority
2. Feng et al. lab could beat Leo to mechanistic follow-up
3. Dataset availability unknown (need to email Feng et al. for emotion-varied stimuli)

**Action:** Note in goals.md as "Track 5 candidate - YELLOW gate" — do NOT develop further until Papers A+B are submitted. Revisit after NeurIPS 2026 deadline. Add to backlog-scan-list.md for monitoring.

## 🔄 Milestone Lessons (100-cycle retrospective)

1. **Citation trails > arXiv scans on weekends** — Semantic Scholar finds papers in Leo's exact lab cluster that arXiv feeds miss (NTU lab papers: SAKE, Feng et al. all found via citation trail, not arXiv)

2. **Meta-board worked** — forced 6 system improvements; would have burned 20+ tokens on wasted skip cycles without it. Week 10 target: open 1-2 new Qs per week

3. **Idea gate is essential** — Idea #7 (Audio T-SAE) was added to goals.md BEFORE gate ran; gate confirmed it. Rule now: gate FIRST, then goals.md. Saves effort on pruning low-ROI ideas.

4. **Execution-blocked is a learning mode, not a failure** — cycles #85-95 (ARENA pre-digests + Paper A method upgrade) were highest ROI of all 100 cycles despite being execution-blocked. Synthesis is work.

5. **Leo's competitive window is real and closing** — FCCT (vision causal tracing, AAAI 2026 Oral) suggests a speech extension in 6-9 months. 2 months to NeurIPS deadline means Paper A experiment NEEDS to start in March. Priority: unblock first.

## Next Action (Cycle #101)
- Weekend Protocol option (b): foundational paper read
- Best target: **DAS (Distributed Alignment Search, Wu et al., 2022, arXiv:2209.11895)** — the exact algorithm behind gc(k) in Paper A; not yet fully read (only referenced in IIT paper); 15-page tutorial; MacBook no-dependencies read
- Alternative: **pyvene paper (Wu et al., 2024, arXiv:2403.07809)** — same authors, open-source implementation
