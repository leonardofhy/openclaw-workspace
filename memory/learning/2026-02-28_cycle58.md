# 🧠 Cycle #58 — 2026-02-28 04:31
## Action: plan
## Context: 4:31 AM, arXiv Feb 28 batch not available until ~14:00 Taipei. All meta-cycles (#50-57) complete. Paper A pitch done (#57). Paper B pitch was the one concrete gap in the 2-paper portfolio documentation. High-value plan = highest available action.
## Content:
Created `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` — full 1-page pitch for **"AudioSAEBench: Multi-Metric Evaluation of SAEs for Speech and Audio Language Models"**:

**Key structure:**
- 5-category framework: Concept Detection, Disentanglement, Reconstruction Fidelity, Causal Controllability, **Grounding Sensitivity (NOVEL)**
- Grounding Sensitivity `gc(F)` = feature-level IIT accuracy using ALME 57K conflict stimuli (same formula as Paper A's `gc(L)`, different granularity)
- Comparison table vs AudioSAE/Mariotte/AR&D: AudioSAEBench wins on multi-metric coverage; Grounding Sensitivity = zero competitors
- MVP = Cat 1 + Cat 5 only, Whisper-small + Qwen2-Audio (submittable to NeurIPS 2026 D&B)
- Execution roadmap: Cat 1+3 MacBook-feasible immediately after venv; Cat 5 after Paper A E1 validates gc

**Portfolio is now fully documented:**
- Paper A: `paper-a-pitch.md` — "Localizing the Listen Layer" (NeurIPS 2026 main or Interspeech 2026)
- Paper B: `paper-b-pitch.md` — "AudioSAEBench" (NeurIPS 2026 D&B track)
- Both connected by: same gc metric, same ALME stimuli, same NNsight infrastructure, same IIT theory

## Next: arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 Taipei) is the next high-value action. Consider skipping until then unless Leo unblocks experiments.
