# 🧠 Cycle #35 — 2026-02-27 08:01
## Action: report
## Context: Leo just woke up (8:01 AM). Queue has been depleted since cycle #28. All must-reads complete, all tools verified, two experiment proposals ready. Highest-value action = morning handoff report.

## Content: Morning Handoff to Leo

arXiv checked — no new Feb 27 submissions yet (appear ~14:00 Taipei). No new papers found.

Overnight work (cycles #19-34, ~midnight to 8am):
- Deep-read Causal Abstraction (Geiger et al.) → IIT = activation patching formalized; grounding_coefficient now has theoretical grounding
- Deep-read Multimodal MI Survey (Lin 2025) → speech COMPLETELY ABSENT = confirmed white space
- arXiv scan (cycles #24-28, #30): 3 new papers deep-read (Zhao 2601.03115, Kawamura 2602.15307, Mariotte 2509.24793), 2 new gaps found
- NNsight API assessed → NNsight wins over pyvene (cleaner syntax + NDIF remote GPU access)
- Triple Convergence IIT experiment proposal crystallized (cycle #34)

Queue status: DEPLETED. All autonomous actions complete. Awaiting Leo.

## Next: Leo's action items (in priority order)
1. **Real speech test** — run `python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py` with a real .wav file (validates Triple Convergence with real data vs synthetic sine wave)
2. **Approve IIT experiment** — cycle #34 proposal: NNsight + Whisper-small + minimal pair patches; ~3h on MacBook
3. **Create venv** — `python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env && source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate && pip install nnsight openai-whisper`
4. **arXiv Feb 27 scan** — check ~14:00 Taipei for new cs.SD/cs.CL submissions
5. **Optional: Contact 智凱哥** about AudioLens codebase access (mentioned in goals.md)
