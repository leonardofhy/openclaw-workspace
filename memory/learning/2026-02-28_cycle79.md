# 🧠 Cycle #79 — 2026-02-28 15:01
## Action: learn (triage + meta-awareness)
## Context: arXiv Feb 28 batch still not posted (~3 PM Taipei, expected after 14:00). Cron tagged meta-awareness; cycle #78 was Day 3 synthesis reflect 30 min ago. Ran competitive scan to check for new papers.

## Content

### arXiv Status
- cs.SD/recent: most recent entries still Feb 27, 2026. Feb 28 batch not posted yet.
- Queries run: mech interp × speech, SAE × audio, audio language model interpretability, speech LLM causal patching
- **New Feb 28 papers found: 0**

### New Paper Found (previously unscanned, Nov 2025)
**MMA-Bench: "Some Modalities are More Equal Than Others" (arXiv:2511.22826, Chen et al., Nov 2025)**
- cs.CV paper — vision-language, not speech
- **Core question**: Are MLLMs robust to *contradicting* modalities?
- **Method**: MMA-Bench with misaligned audio-visual pairs + misleading text; black-box + white-box interpretability
- **Key finding**: Current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs → lack robust multimodal reasoning
- **Proposed fix**: Modality alignment tuning (teach model when to prioritize/leverage/ignore specific modality cues)
- **ASSESSMENT: SCAN, not deep-read** — vision domain, behavioral analysis (not causal layer-wise patching), but methodologically adjacent to Track 3
- **Connection to Leo's work**: MMA-Bench = behavioral complement to grounding_coefficient. Key GAP: their analysis uses black-box + white-box (no layer-wise causal patching), vision domain only. Leo's Track 3 = causal + speech. The paper motivates "modality prioritization" framing for Paper A's pitch.

### Also noted (prev. search, Jan 2026)
**"When Tone and Words Disagree" (Huang et al., Jan 7, 2026)** — SER under acoustic-semantic conflict
- Behavioral: acoustic emotion ≠ semantic content → models degrade
- No mechanistic analysis (just evaluates robustness)
- Relevance: conflict stimuli design similar to ALME; confirms real-world grounding gap
- ASSESSMENT: SCAN only

### Meta-Awareness Check (Leo's 01:04 instruction)
System questions for this cycle:
1. **Is the paper scan still producing value?** Answer: Diminishing — same papers re-appearing, Feb 28 not posted. But today found 1 new adjacent paper (MMA-Bench). Worth 1 scan/afternoon.
2. **Are cycle notes getting too long?** Yes — cycles #50-78 show meta cycles with 500+ word notes. Action: apply the 3-line report standard from cycle #52 meta-board more strictly.
3. **What's the highest-leverage thing right now?** Leo reviewing unblock-request.md (paper pitches A+B). Secondary: when Feb 28 batch posts (~today evening), scan immediately.

### Reversible improvement (meta-awareness rule: 1 improvement per cycle)
**Applied**: Updated `backlog-scan-list.md` to add MMA-Bench (2511.22826) to "adjacent methods" backlog with 2-line note. This prevents re-discovering it and keeps the scan list current.

## Next: 
- arXiv Feb 28 batch: next scan cycle at ~17:00-18:00 Taipei (batch usually appears by then on weekends)
- Leo unblock: IIT experiment approval + real speech test + venv setup
- Paper A pitch review
