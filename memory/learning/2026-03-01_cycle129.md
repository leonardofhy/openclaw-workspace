# 🧠 Cycle #129 — 2026-03-01 16:01
## Action: reflect (meta-audit — skip guard triggered)
## Context: 
Skip guard triggered: cycles #126 (skip) + #128 (skip) = 2 consecutive execution-blocked skips. Per SKILL.md rule, next cycle must be reflect(meta-audit). Meta-board is 24/24 count-saturated; last reflect was only 1h ago (#127 15:01). This cycle must produce genuine value, not Q-farming.

### arXiv Verification (dead zone confirmed)
Both search queries run fresh (16:01 Sunday):
- "mechanistic interpretability speech" → newest = AR&D (Feb 24), Kawamura (Feb 16), Brain-to-speech (Feb 1). **0 new papers.**
- "sparse autoencoder audio" → newest = AR&D (Feb 24), TADA! (Feb 12). **0 new papers.**
Dead zone confirmed. Weekend gap holds. Next expected batch: Monday ~14:00 Taipei.

### Meta-Audit: Dead Zone Performance Review

**What happened in the dead zone (cycles #96-129, ~33 cycles)?**

| Category | Count | Quality |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Principled skips (correct) | 12 | ✅ |
| Meta-reflect with genuine output | 9 | ✅ |
| Timestamp-refresh (anti-pattern Q24) | 3 | ❌ reclassified |
| Weekend Protocol actions (citation/foundational/pre-flight) | 3 | ✅ |
| triage learn (citation scan, arXiv check) | 4 | ✅ |
| **Total productive cycles** | **16/33** | **48% novelty** |

**Root cause analysis of 3 timestamp-refresh cycles:**
- Cycles #120-122: refreshed duration counter + cycle count = zero intellectual value
- Guard was not operational at the time (Q24 added retroactively at cycle #124)
- Q24 fix IS in place going forward → this specific failure mode is closed

### One Actionable Improvement: "Weekend Depletion Signal" Rule

**Observation:** The meta-awareness cycles (#98-127) were genuinely valuable EARLY in the weekend but showed diminishing returns by cycle #120+. The meta-burst 4h pause (Q23) helped but wasn't precise enough — it paused too broadly.

**Root cause:** No signal for "this weekend's meta budget is spent." The system kept returning to meta-awareness because it was the only available action category — but the budget for novel Qs was exhausted by cycle #115 (not cycle #124 when Q24 closed it).

**New rule (Q26 — apply immediately):**
> **Weekend Depletion Signal:** When `meta-board_Qs_added_this_weekend == 0 AND skip_count_since_last_real_learn >= 5`, declare "Meta Budget Spent." From this point: ONLY do arXiv checks (1 query per cycle) or principled skips. No new meta-reflects until arXiv Monday batch OR Leo unblocks.

This is a tightening of Q23 (4h pause) — the 4h pause can be bypassed by "genuine Q" claims, which Q24+Q25 showed are sometimes spurious. "0 new Qs this weekend" is a harder, less gameable criterion.

**Applied immediately:** Meta Budget is now SPENT for this weekend (0 new Qs since cycle #125 = 3h ago). Next cycles until Monday arXiv: arXiv check (1 query) then principled skip.

### State Assessment
- **Skip guard:** ✅ SATISFIED — this cycle produced genuine output (rule Q26, classification audit, dead zone review)
- **SUNDAY-BRIEF:** ✅ Current — Leo can navigate in <2 min
- **Unblock request:** PENDING ~46h — no relay path available from cron context
- **Competition clock:** FCCT = 0 speech citations. Gap still open. Leo window still clear.

## Next:
- Cycles #130+: principled skip (Meta Budget Spent) OR arXiv Monday ~14:00 → learn
- **Leo action queue:** See SUNDAY-BRIEF.md + unblock-request.md (no change to top 4 priorities)
- **Q26:** Meta Budget Spent rule added to meta-awareness-board.md this cycle
