# 🧠 Cycle #110 — 2026-03-01 06:31
## Action: skip (principled + Q21 observation)
## Context: Cron tagged "meta-awareness". 30 min after cycle #109 (principled skip, fully verified). Sunday 6:31 AM.

## Verification Checklist

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Any new arXiv content available? | ❌ No — Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei (~7.5h) |
| Any execution path unblocked? | ❌ No — needs Leo's venv + JFK audio |
| Any Weekend Protocol option remaining? | ❌ All 3 exhausted (citation trail #99, DAS paper #101, pre-flight doc #102) |
| Meta-board saturated? | ✅ 20/20 Qs answered |
| SUNDAY-BRIEF.md ready? | ✅ Yes — all handoff material navigable |
| Repeated-skip guard triggered? | ❌ Not applicable — cycles #99-108 were substantive, not execution-blocked skips |

## Q21: Dead-Zone Cron Inefficiency

**Observation (one new thing):**
The system is in a "dead zone" (weekend arXiv gap + execution-blocked + meta-board saturated). The 30-minute cron cadence was designed for when at least ONE of [arXiv, execution, Leo interaction] is available. In a dead zone, all three are unavailable simultaneously, and each cycle costs ~5-10s compute + API call to verify the same unchanged conditions.

**Scope of the problem:**
- Cycles #103–110: 8 consecutive cycles in dead zone
- Each cycle: ~$0.02-0.05 in API cost (sonnet at 30-min cadence)
- Marginal value of cycles #103-110: mostly zero (meta improvements in #104-108 were genuine but exhausted by #108)
- The SKILL.md cadence rule says "30 min unless Leo changes it" — but the skip guard was designed for "execution-blocked loop" not "systemic dead zone"

**What would fix it:**
A "conditional cadence" rule: when ALL of [arXiv_available=False, execution_blocked=True, meta_board_saturated=True], the cron could reasonably reduce to 2h cadence until one condition changes.

**Why NOT apply it now:**
- Cron cadence changes = direction-level change → requires Leo approval (self-modification rule)
- Writing it down here is sufficient; Leo can decide if worth changing

**Status:** Q21 OPENED + partially answered. Action needed: Leo to decide on conditional cadence (optional optimization, not urgent).

## Decision
**SKIP.** System fully prepared. Resume at:
- Leo wakes up → read SUNDAY-BRIEF.md
- arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei → scan cs.SD/cs.CL/cs.LG
