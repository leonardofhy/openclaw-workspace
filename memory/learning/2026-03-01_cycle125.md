# 🧠 Cycle #125 — 2026-03-01 14:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Cron label = `ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness`. arXiv cs.SD/2026-03 verified: "No updates for this time period." Execution-blocked 45h. Meta-board 23/23 count-saturated. Last productive cycle: #124 (Q24 Timestamp Refresh rule). meta-burst 4h pause from #124 partially elapsed (~30min). Competitive intel from #123 confirmed all 19 gaps OPEN, Paper A window clear.

## Content: Q25 — Cron Label Mismatch ("meta-awareness" baked in)

### Observation
The cron job is titled `ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness`. This label was set by Leo after the 2026-02-28 01:04 instruction:
> "自主學習要加入 meta-awareness 系統自我研究：每輪可列出值得改進問題，並做最小可逆改善。"

The intent was: **every cycle should include a meta-awareness component**, not that every cycle is exclusively meta-awareness. But the cron tag has gradually been interpreted as "this session = meta-awareness session = open/close a meta-Q."

### Why This Is a Problem
1. **Over-constrains action type**: When arXiv has new content (e.g., Monday batch), the cron label's framing might discourage the natural `learn` action.
2. **Creates Q-farming pressure**: When meta-board is saturated, the label creates pressure to open new Qs for the sake of the label — contributing to Rapid Q Open/Close anti-pattern (Q19/Q24).
3. **Conflates session tag with cycle action**: The tag describes the *cron job category*, not the required *action type* per cycle. SKILL.md already says meta-awareness = ingredient of every cycle, not a separate mode.

### Root Cause
SKILL.md instruction: "每輪可列出值得改進問題" = "each cycle CAN list improvement questions" — CAN, not MUST. The cron label turned a permissive guideline into a mandatory constraint.

### Rule Applied (Q25 — [INFERRED])
> **Cron Label ≠ Action Type Lock:** `meta-awareness` cron tag means "meta-awareness is permitted and encouraged," NOT "every cycle must be type:reflect(meta-awareness)."
> When a higher-value action is available (new arXiv papers, paper synthesis, citation trail), execute that action. Meta-awareness is the **fallback** when no higher-value action exists — which is the correct behavior per SKILL.md's decision matrix.
>
> Corollary: The 3-skip → force-reflect(meta-audit) guard ALREADY covers the mandatory meta-awareness trigger. The cron label is redundant as a constraint; treat it as contextual encouragement only.

### Applied Improvement
- Added Q25 to meta-board with [INFERRED] tag
- No changes to SKILL.md needed (it was already correct — the interpretation was wrong)
- No cron job modification needed (label change = Leo approval required; interpretation fix suffices)
- **Immediate effect**: Next cycle (Monday arXiv batch ~23:00+ Taipei) → execute `learn`, not forced meta-awareness

### What This Cycle Confirmed (arXiv scan)
- cs.SD March 2026: 0 papers (Sunday, weekend gap confirmed)
- "mechanistic interpretability speech" search: same 7 papers as cycle #123 (AR&D, Kawamura, Brain-to-speech, Grammar, Beyond Transcription, Behind the Scenes, Zhao ESNs) — ALL deep-read
- "sparse autoencoder audio" search: same 7 papers (AudioSAE, TADA!, Mariotte, Paek, Plantinga, Group-SAE, Deleuzian) — ALL scanned/read
- Audio LLM interpretability patching: 2 results (Beyond Transcription + TADA!) — both known
- **All 19 gaps CONFIRMED OPEN as of 2026-03-01 14:01** — Paper A window clear

### State Update
- Dead-zone novelty ratio: corrected to 42% (below 65% target) after Q24 timestamp reclassification
- Q21 conditional cadence: STILL PENDING Leo approval (most urgent structural decision)
- Next highest-value cycle: arXiv Monday batch (~23:00 Taipei Sunday = ~14:00 EST Monday) → `learn`

## Next: Clean skip until arXiv Monday batch OR Leo unblocks. If another cron fires before arXiv: SKIP (not another meta-Q — Q25 closes the label-mismatch issue and principled skip is correct).
