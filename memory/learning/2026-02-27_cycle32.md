# 🧠 Cycle #32 — 2026-02-27 06:00
## Action: skip (with arXiv re-verification)
## Context: 6:00 AM Day 2 morning. Queue depleted after 31 cycles overnight. Checked arXiv for any new papers on (1) mechanistic interpretability × speech/audio, (2) sparse autoencoder × audio — no new entries since cycle #24 scan. Same 4 papers in mech interp × speech; same 3 in audio SAE.
## Content:
- arXiv search: "mechanistic interpretability speech audio" → 4 results (Kawamura, Zhao, Behind the Scenes, Beyond Transcription) — same as before
- arXiv search: "sparse autoencoder audio speech" → same 3 audio SAE papers (AudioSAE, Mariotte, Plantinga-PD)
- No new papers have appeared in the target area since yesterday's scan
- All planned reading is complete (must-read list exhausted at cycle #22)
- Next high-value actions all require Leo or physical resources

## Next: Leo wakes up ~8-9 AM. Priority queue:
1. Real speech test — whisper_hook_demo.py with actual .wav file
2. Create venv + install nnsight → `python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env && pip install nnsight pyvene`
3. Present "Causal AudioLens" + "Class-specific Neuron Grounding" sketches to Leo for approval
4. Design Triple Convergence IIT experiment (conceptual, awaiting Leo review)
