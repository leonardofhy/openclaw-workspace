# 🧠 Cycle #117 — 2026-03-01 10:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — morning relay)
## Context: meta-burst 4h pause active (expires ~13:01); arXiv Monday batch ~4h away; morning window = Leo waking up range; meta-awareness cron label
## Content:
**State verified** — nothing changed since cycle #116 (09:31 skip). All conditions unchanged:
- arXiv: same 3 papers as last scan (no weekend batch)
- execution-blocked: ~42h (since cycle #42, Feb 27 16:01)
- meta-board: 22/22 Qs answered, SATURATED
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: updated timestamp to cycle #117 (was #112)
- unblock-request.md: current and accurate (cycle #105 refresh)

**Morning relay:** SUNDAY-BRIEF.md is now timestamp-fresh for when Leo wakes up. Primary relay file. No other action needed.

**Meta-burst check:** 4h pause active (started ~09:01, expires ~13:01). This cycle's update was a micro-maintenance action (<2 min), not a meta-burst cycle. Rule respected.

**Next scheduled high-value action:** arXiv Monday batch at ~14:00 Taipei (cs.SD + cs.CL scan).
## Next: arXiv Monday scan ~14:00 Taipei. If Leo wakes up before then → route to SUNDAY-BRIEF.md → unblock-request.md.
