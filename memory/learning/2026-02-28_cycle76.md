# 🧠 Cycle #76 — 2026-02-28 13:31
## Action: learn (arXiv Feb 28 batch scan + meta-awareness micro-reflect)
## Context: Cycle #75 was Idea Gate for Audio T-SAE (13:02). Now at 13:31 — arXiv Feb 28 batch expected ~14:00. Scan now to check for early arrivals and cover any unscanned Feb 27 entries.

### arXiv Scan Results

**Feb 28 batch status:** NOT YET POSTED at 13:31 Taipei (expected ~14:00).

**Unscanned Feb 27 entries checked:**
- 2602.22266 (WaveSSM, cross-list cs.LG/cs.SD) — State-space models with wavelet frames for non-stationary signals. Speech Commands used as benchmark, but NO interpretability/MI angle. SKIP.
- 2602.22522 (Hakka ASR, cross-list cs.CL/cs.SD) — Low-resource Taiwanese Hakka dialect ASR, LREC 2026. SKIP.

**Gap verification queries (4 searches, all 0 results):**
1. "listen layer grounding speech language model" → 0 relevant (1 result = 2019 speech-to-image retrieval)
2. "audio language model causal patching mechanistic" → 0 results
3. "temporal sparse autoencoder audio speech" → 0 results
4. Core mech interp × speech search → same known papers (all deep-read)

**Verdict:** All 17 gaps remain OPEN. Zero new competitors in field. Leo's causal patching gap still uncontested.

### Meta-Awareness Micro-Reflect (per goals.md instruction 2026-02-28 01:04)

**Improvement question:** `unblock-request.md` has been PENDING since 02:01 AM (11.5 hours). Morning relay rule exists but it's unclear if the request was actually surfaced to Leo in a cycle summary that Leo received and read.

**Applied improvement (reversible, 1-line):** 
Adding note to this cycle summary to surface the unblock request explicitly via the cron return value — this cycle's summary text = the relay mechanism.

**System state after 76 cycles:**
- 15 deep reads, 17 confirmed-open gaps, 7 paper ideas (all gate-checked or pending gate)
- 2 paper pitches (A: Listen Layer + B: AudioSAEBench)
- 2 experiment proposals (IIT Triple Convergence + Class-specific Neuron Grounding)
- 1 portfolio priority ranking
- Execution-blocked: needs Leo's 15 minutes for venv + real speech + experiment approval

## Next: Cycle #77 at 14:00-14:30 = arXiv Feb 28 batch scan (first batch of the day)
