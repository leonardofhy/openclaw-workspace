# 🧠 Cycle #115 — 2026-03-01 10:45
## Action: skip (principled — verified dead zone)
## Context: 
Sunday 10:45 AM. arXiv weekend gap confirmed (same 3 papers as last scan: AR&D/Kawamura/Brain-to-Speech-BCI). Brain-to-Speech paper (Maghsoudi & Mishra, Feb 2026) = BCI domain, not audio LLMs, SKIP. Zero new papers in Leo's space. Execution-blocked 43h. Meta-board 20/20 SATURATED. Weekend Protocol 3/3 exhausted. Leo briefed ~1.5h ago (cycle #111). Skip guard intent = prevent complacency; not applicable here (meta-board saturated, genuine external block).
## Content: 
arXiv verification performed (2 queries). No new competitors. All 20 gaps still open. Principled skip.
## Next: arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei OR Leo unblocks Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry). SUNDAY-BRIEF.md ready.
