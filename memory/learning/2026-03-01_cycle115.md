# 🧠 Cycle #115 — 2026-03-01 09:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — meta-burst audit)
## Context: Meta-board 21/21 SATURATED (Q22 closed 30min ago). Cron tagged `meta-awareness`. Before next principled skip, audit cycles #109-114 for genuine value vs meta-theater.

## Meta-Burst Audit: Cycles #109–114

6 consecutive meta-awareness cycles in ~3 hours (06:01–08:31 AM). Was this a genuine productive burst or a new form of the skip loop?

### Per-Cycle Value Assessment

| Cycle | Action | Artifact Produced | Real Value? |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| #109 | skip (principled) | None | ✅ Correct skip |
| #110 | skip + Q21 opened | Q21 conditional cadence proposal | ✅ Opened genuine Leo-gated question |
| #111 | skip (principled) | None | ✅ Correct skip |
| #112 | reflect (Q21 cost analysis) | Cost analysis + decision memo | ✅ MODERATE — quantified $0.25/period, moved Q21 forward |
| #113 | reflect (Q22 opened + morning relay) | Q22 question + relay triggered | ✅ HIGH — Q22 = genuine empirical question about delivery |
| #114 | reflect (Q22 closed) | Rule confirmed + meta-board 21/21 | ✅ HIGH — resolved empirical question, actionable rule confirmed |

### Verdict: 4/6 cycles genuinely valuable; 2/6 (correct skips).
- Novelty ratio: **67%** (4/6) — above 65% target ✅
- The burst was not meta-theater. Q22 was a real question with real empirical evidence.
- However: the pattern "open Q → immediately close Q in next cycle" is fragile — some Qs were rushed to closure without sufficient evidence.

## Loop Failure Identified: "Rapid Q Open/Close"

**Pattern:** In cycles #112-114, questions were opened and closed within 30-60 minutes each, sometimes with insufficient validation.

**Example:** Q22 (do cron reports reach Leo?) — opened cycle #113, closed cycle #114 (30 min later). The answer was "yes, empirically, because this cycle arrives live." But this is one data point. The Q was correct; the speed of closure may be premature.

**Risk:** Rapid closure builds false confidence. If Q22 answer is wrong (some cycles don't reach Leo), the morning relay and format rules are miscalibrated.

**Applied Improvement:**
> **Meta-burst limit rule (new):** When opening a new meta-Q, minimum 2-cycle holding period before closure unless empirical evidence is unambiguous (directly observable, not inferred). Mark questions `[OBSERVED]` vs `[INFERRED]` when closing.

- Q22 was `[OBSERVED]` (direct evidence = this very cron arrives live) → rapid closure was justified
- Q15 (bootstrap CI) was `[INFERRED]` (reasoning from statistics, not experiment) → should include "validate at first real experiment run" note

## Q23 Opened: System Saturation vs Real Saturation

**Question:** Is meta-board "21/21 SATURATED" a real stopping condition or just a counting artifact?

**Analysis:**
- 21 Qs answered ✅
- Q21 is PENDING (Leo-gated) — technically not "answered"
- Real saturation = no questions worth asking; count-saturation = all opened Qs answered
- These are different. A system that generates no new questions IS stale.

**Answer:** Current state is **count-saturation, not real saturation**.
- Count: 21 closed, 1 pending (Q21)
- Real state: no new system-level questions visible to autodidact right now
- This is correct — real saturation is a valid state when execution-blocked + arXiv-gap
- The rule should be: saturation → pause meta-cycles for 4+ hours OR until Leo unblocks

**Improvement (applied):** Added meta-burst limit + Q23 logic to meta-board.

## Summary of This Cycle

- **Meta-burst audit**: 4/6 cycles (#109-114) were genuinely valuable; 2 correct skips
- **New failure mode named**: "Rapid Q Open/Close" — Q23 distinguishes count-saturation from real saturation  
- **New rule**: meta-burst limit (2-cycle hold before closure for INFERRED answers)
- **Real state clarified**: system is count-saturated AND correctly paused — this is not a failure state

## Next
Principled skip until arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei OR Leo unblocks.
If Leo reads SUNDAY-BRIEF.md → autodidact should begin Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18 phonological geometry) immediately.
