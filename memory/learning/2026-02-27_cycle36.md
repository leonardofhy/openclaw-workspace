# 🧠 Cycle #36 — 2026-02-27 09:02
## Action: plan
## Context:
Queue depleted since cycle #28. Cycles #29-35 were skips + morning report. arXiv Feb 27 batch not available until ~14:00. Leo waking up ~9 AM. Best action: tidy the knowledge-graph to reflect overnight gains (cycles #30 Gap #13 + cycle #34 IIT proposal were missing), and deliver a clean Leo handoff.

## Content:
**Knowledge-graph updates:**
1. Added **Experiment 1: Triple Convergence IIT Test** (cycle #34 plan proposal) — formally connected to Geiger et al. causal abstraction theory. Specifies MacBook-feasible setup: NNsight + Whisper-small, minimal pairs, sweep all layers for peak Δacc. Prediction: IIT peak at ~50% depth = Triple Convergence zone.
2. Added **Gap #13: EmoOmni / Thinker-Talker Emotional Bottleneck** (cycle #30 discovery) — first to mechanistically diagnose where emotion signal is lost in dual-module architectures. Tool: logit-lens + patching at connector boundary.
3. Added paper opportunities **#5** (Class-specific Neuron Grounding) and **#6** (Temporal Audio SAE) from cycles #25-27.
4. Knowledge-graph section H now lists 6 crystallized paper ideas (was 4).

**DIAGNOSE (quick):**
- **Position**: 12 deep reads complete, toolchain verified, 2 experiment proposals ready, 13 gaps mapped, 6 paper ideas crystallized.
- **Target**: First IIT patching experiment on real speech → validate Triple Convergence causally.
- **Gap**: Everything requires Leo now — real .wav file, venv creation, experiment approval.

**Morning queue for Leo (priority order):**
1. ✅ Approve IIT experiment (cycle #34 proposal + Experiment 1 in knowledge-graph)
2. ✅ Real speech test — provide any .wav file → run whisper_hook_demo.py to validate Triple Convergence
3. ✅ Create venv: `python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env && source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate && pip install nnsight openai-whisper`
4. ⏰ arXiv Feb 27 scan — ~14:00 Taipei (cs.SD + cs.CL + cs.LG)
5. 📬 Contact 智凱哥 about AudioLens codebase access (enables Track 3 experiments on GPU models)

**Research state summary:**
- Triple Convergence Hypothesis: confirmed empirically (our run) + 4 papers converge; IIT theory predicts it; untested causally → first experiment target
- Causal AudioLens: the clearest first paper; closes gap in both AudioLens + "Behind the Scenes" simultaneously
- grounding_coefficient: operationalized (ratio of denoising Δacc; IIT-grounded by Geiger et al.)
- NNsight > pyvene for encoder interventions; NDIF enables large model access without GPU

## Next:
Leo morning session → await IIT experiment approval → begin venv setup and real speech patching
