# 📊 Autodidact Progress Log

| Cycle | Time | Action | Summary |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| #1 | 2026-02-26 14:22 | learn | UniWhisper — unified audio representation, 20-task eval |
| #2 | 2026-02-26 14:28 | learn | AudioMatters competitive landscape — 8 benchmarks scanned |
| #3 | 2026-02-26 14:31 | learn | **Mech Interp × Speech** field scan — only 4 papers exist! 3 paper ideas generated |
| #4 | 2026-02-26 15:05 | reflect | Day 1 wrap: field map solid, next priority = deep-read "Beyond Transcription" post-AudioMatters |
| #5 | 2026-02-26 16:00 | skip | AudioMatters CMT deadline today 19:00 — correctly skipped per values.md #5 |

## Cumulative Stats
- Papers read (deep): 1
- Papers scanned: 12
- Research gaps identified: 3 (speech mech interp, speech safety, speech interp toolkit)
- Paper ideas: 3
- Code written: 0
- Days active: 1

| #6 | 2026-02-26 16:30 | learn | **Deep-read "Beyond Transcription"** — encoder lens, patching methods, encoder encodes context (not just acoustics), hallucination detection from decoder residual stream (93.4% acc), connects directly to "Listen vs Guess" Track 3 |

## Cumulative Stats

## Recommended Next Cycle
Cycle #7: deep-read **AudioLens** (智凱哥, arXiv:2506.05140) — lab collaboration advantage, logit-lens for LALMs, most directly relevant to Leo's Track 3.
