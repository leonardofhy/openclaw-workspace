# 📊 Autodidact Progress Log

| Cycle | Time | Action | Summary |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| #1 | 2026-02-26 14:22 | learn | UniWhisper — unified audio representation, 20-task eval |
| #2 | 2026-02-26 14:28 | learn | AudioMatters competitive landscape — 8 benchmarks scanned |
| #3 | 2026-02-26 14:31 | learn | **Mech Interp × Speech** field scan — only 4 papers exist! 3 paper ideas generated |
| #4 | 2026-02-26 15:05 | reflect | Day 1 wrap: field map solid, next priority = deep-read "Beyond Transcription" post-AudioMatters |
| #5 | 2026-02-26 16:00 | skip | AudioMatters CMT deadline today 19:00 — correctly skipped per values.md #5 |

## Cumulative Stats
- Papers read (deep): 1
- Papers scanned: 12
- Research gaps identified: 3 (speech mech interp, speech safety, speech interp toolkit)
- Paper ideas: 3
- Code written: 0
- Days active: 1

| #6 | 2026-02-26 16:30 | learn | **Deep-read "Beyond Transcription"** — encoder lens, patching methods, encoder encodes context (not just acoustics), hallucination detection from decoder residual stream (93.4% acc), connects directly to "Listen vs Guess" Track 3 |

## Cumulative Stats

| #7 | 2026-02-26 17:00 | learn | **Deep-read AudioLens** (NTU 李宏毅 lab, ASRU 2025) — Logit Lens on LALMs: LALMs query audio directly > aggregate in text tokens; critical layer correlates with accuracy; +16.3% improvement training-free; **key gap = no causal patching = Leo's opportunity** |

## Cumulative Stats
- Papers read (deep): 3
- Papers scanned: 12
- Research gaps identified: 4 (+AudioLens no-causal-patching gap)
- Paper ideas: 3
- Code written: 0
- Days active: 1

| #8 | 2026-02-26 17:31 | learn | **Deep-read AudioSAE** — SAE on all 12 layers of Whisper/HuBERT; 70% hallucination FPR reduction via feature steering; layer 6-7 = speech/acoustic transition zone; may unify with saturation layer (BeyondTranscription) and critical layer (AudioLens); speech concepts distributed (need 2000 features vs tens for text) |

## Cumulative Stats
- Papers read (deep): 4
- Papers scanned: 12
- Research gaps identified: 4
- Paper ideas: 3

## Recommended Next Cycle
Cycle #9: **skill-up** — TransformerLens + pyvene installation and first run on text model. 3 deep reads done; time to move from reading to doing. MacBook-feasible.
