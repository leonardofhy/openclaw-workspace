# 🧠 Cycle #121 — 2026-03-01 12:01
## Action: skip (principled — meta-burst pause active, dead zone holds)
## Context: Meta-burst 4h pause started ~09:01, expires ~13:01. Still 1h remaining. arXiv Monday batch ~26h away. Execution-blocked 44h. Meta-board 22/22 saturated. No new arXiv papers. No Leo unblock. All conditions identical to cycle #119-120.
## Content:
State verified:
- arXiv: weekend gap, Monday batch ~Mon Mar 2 14:00 Taipei
- Execution-blocked: ~44h since cycle #42
- Meta-board: 22/22 Qs (saturated)
- Meta-burst pause: active until ~13:01 today
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: current (updated through cycle #120)
- unblock-request.md: current

No high-value action available. Meta-burst pause must be respected (skip-interrupt of pause = defeats the rule's purpose).

## Next: Meta-burst pause expires 13:01 → then principled skip (arXiv Monday ~14:00 OR Leo unblock). If Leo reviews SUNDAY-BRIEF.md → Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment).
