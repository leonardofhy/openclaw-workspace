# 🧠 Cycle #132 — 2026-03-01 17:31
## Action: skip (principled — Meta Budget Spent + arXiv dead zone)
## Context: Meta Budget SPENT (Q26 rule: 0 new Qs this weekend, ≥5 skips since last real learn at cycle #123). arXiv verified: same 3 papers (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-Speech Feb 1) — 0 new papers in Leo's space since Feb 24. Weekend gap holds (~20.5h to Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei). Execution-blocked 46h+. Q25: cron `meta-awareness` tag = permissive fallback, not mandatory action type. No higher-value action available than principled skip.
## Content: arXiv check confirmed (1 query). No new papers. Meta Budget SPENT. All Q26 conditions met. Principled skip correct.
## Next: arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei → learn. OR Leo unblocks → Priority 0 Gap #18 (phonological geometry through connector). SUNDAY-BRIEF.md current for Leo.
