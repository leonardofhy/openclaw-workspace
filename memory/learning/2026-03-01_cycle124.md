# 🧠 Cycle #124 — 2026-03-01 13:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Cron tagged meta-awareness; meta-burst 4h pause expired at 13:01 (cycle #123 used expired window for competitive intelligence learn). Post-Q23 first clean meta cycle. 

## Content: Q24 — "Timestamp Refresh" Anti-Pattern

### Observation
Cycles #120–122 (11:31 AM–12:31 PM) each produced only timestamp updates to unblock-request.md and SUNDAY-BRIEF.md. No new intellectual content. The cycle notes themselves were minimal (< 2 lines). This is a distinct failure mode from Rapid Q Open/Close (Q19).

### Root Cause
The meta-burst 4h pause rule (added cycle #115) was designed to stop meta-cycles from looping. But #120–122 treated "timestamp refresh" as exempt from the pause — reasoning "we're not answering Qs, just updating clocks." This exploits a loophole in the pause rule.

### Why This Matters
- Each "timestamp refresh" cycle costs ~$0.03–0.05 in tokens for zero intellectual value
- 3 such cycles = ~$0.10 wasted + inflated cycle count (makes cycle #s misleading)
- Bloated progress.md entries distort the novelty_ratio KPI

### Rule Applied (Q24 — [INFERRED], validate at first experiment)
> **"Timestamp Refresh" Rule:** Any cycle whose ONLY output is updating a duration counter or cycle number in an existing file → classify as SKIP in progress.md. Do NOT write a full cycle note. Do not increment "productive cycle" count.
> Corollary: The meta-burst 4h pause applies to timestamp-refresh cycles. They are not exempt.

### Secondary Insight: Diminishing Returns in Dead Zones
Looking at cycles #103–124 (4 AM → 1:31 PM, ~10.5h): 
- 4 genuine skips (principled) ✅
- 4 meta-cycles producing new rules/closures ✅  
- 3 timestamp refresh cycles ❌ (now reclassified as skips)
- 1 competitive intelligence learn ✅
- Effective novelty ratio: 5/12 = 42% (below 65% target)

The dead-zone degradation is real. Q21 (conditional cadence = 2h during dead zones) would have prevented all 3 timestamp-refresh cycles by not triggering at all. Conditional cadence rule is increasingly justified. Adding to SUNDAY-BRIEF.md flag.

### Applied Improvements
1. Q24 rule written to meta-board (this cycle ✅)
2. SUNDAY-BRIEF.md updated: cycle count corrected to 124, Q21 urgency elevated
3. progress.md entry for this cycle: meta-awareness (genuine rule)

## Next: Principled skip until arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei OR Leo unblocks. Competitive intelligence learn (cycle #123) + this meta-awareness cycle = today's productive pair. Stop here.
