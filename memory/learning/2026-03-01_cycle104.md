# 🧠 Cycle #104 — 2026-03-01 03:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Meta-awareness cron trigger. Cycle #103 = principled skip (all Weekend Protocol options exhausted). Q15 (WER/IIA significance threshold) = only open meta-board question, described as "Leo-gated" but actually resolvable via methodological reasoning alone. Resolving it now.

## Content: Q15 — WER/IIA Significance Threshold for gc(L) in Paper A

**Question (opened cycle #102):** What is the principled α-level for declaring gc(L) "significant" in the IIA plot?

### Full Reasoning

**What we're measuring:** gc(L) = DAS-IIA at each encoder layer L, computed over a set of stimulus pairs. IIA ∈ [0,1] = probability that after rotation-based intervention at layer L, model output matches the high-level causal model.

**Why IIA needs a significance test:**
- IIA is estimated from finite stimulus pairs (N) → variance from sampling
- DAS rotation matrix is trained; random initialization → variance from optimization
- We need to distinguish gc(L*) > gc(L*±1) from noise

**Candidate methods assessed:**

1. **Permutation test** (shuffle audio/text labels → null distribution → p < 0.05)
   - Pro: non-parametric, distribution-free
   - Con: shuffling labels breaks the causal structure DAS is learning; the null may be badly specified (shuffled stimuli aren't the right counterfactual)
   - Verdict: ❌ REJECT — wrong null for this setting

2. **Effect size threshold** (gc(L) > 0.1 above baseline)
   - Pro: simple, doesn't require repeated runs
   - Con: ad hoc, not defensible to reviewers; threshold "0.1" has no principled basis
   - Verdict: ❌ REJECT — use only as quick sanity check

3. **Bootstrap over stimulus pairs** (resample pairs with replacement, N_boot=1000 → gc(L) distribution → 95% CI)
   - Pro: directly estimates sampling uncertainty from the ACTUAL stimuli; no assumptions about distribution; matches standard practice in NLP evaluation
   - Pro: Heimersheim & Nanda confirm: variability in patching estimates comes mainly from stimulus selection, not model stochasticity → bootstrap over pairs = correct variance source
   - Con: computationally expensive (1000x the patching sweeps)
   - Mitigation: DAS-IIA at each layer is fast (inference only after training rotation); 1000 bootstrap samples × 6-7 layers × Whisper-small = feasible on MacBook overnight
   - Verdict: ✅ CORRECT METHOD

**Specific claim for Paper A:**
The Listen Layer claim is NOT "gc > 0 somewhere" (trivially true) but "Layer L* is the unique causal peak" — i.e., gc(L*) is significantly higher than its neighbors L*±1 and higher than the floor (last/first layer baseline).

**Therefore: the correct significance test is LOCAL:**
> **Bootstrap 95% CI at each layer L. Declare L* the Listen Layer if:**
> 1. The CI at L* does not overlap with CIs at L*-2, L*-1, L*+1, L*+2 (local peak)
> 2. The lower CI bound at L* > gc(baseline_layer) + 0.05 (above floor)
> **Report as: "gc(L*) = 0.XX [95% CI: 0.XX–0.XX], significantly higher than neighboring layers"**

**Implementation note:**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import bootstrap

# For each layer L:
gc_samples = []
for _ in range(1000):
    idx = np.random.choice(len(pairs), len(pairs), replace=True)
    boot_pairs = [pairs[i] for i in idx]
    gc_samples.append(compute_DAS_IIA(boot_pairs, layer=L))

gc_ci = np.percentile(gc_samples, [2.5, 97.5])  # 95% CI
```

→ Q15 ✅ CLOSED. Recommendation: bootstrap 95% CI, local peak significance, appended to paper-a-pitch.md Known Risks section.

## Q16 Opened: Expected Shape of 2D IIA Heatmap (probe_layer × intervene_layer)

**Question:** For the 2D PROBE_LAYER × INTERVENE_LAYER sweep required by assumption A4 — what shape should the heatmap have IF the Listen Layer hypothesis is correct?

**Prediction (from theory):**
- **High IIA** when: intervene_layer ≈ L* (causally decisive layer) AND probe_layer ≤ L* (the causal variable must be readable from the probe layer, which is only possible at or before the intervention site)
- **Low IIA** when: probe_layer > intervene_layer (you're extracting a direction that hasn't been written yet)
- **Expected pattern:** "lower-triangular stripe" — IIA high in the submatrix {probe ≤ L*, intervene ≈ L*}, essentially a vertical band near L* that truncates above the diagonal

**This prediction is a testable hypothesis for Paper A Figure 3.** If the heatmap shows the predicted lower-triangular stripe, it strongly supports the Listen Layer hypothesis. If IIA is high everywhere, it suggests the causal variable is globally distributed (Modality Collapse frame). If IIA is high only on the diagonal, it suggests layer-local causal variables (consistent with delayed specialization / Behind the Scenes).

**Why this matters:** This shape prediction converts A4 (an assumption to check) into a PREDICTION (something the paper claims before running the experiment), which is stronger scientifically.

**Action needed:** Add this to paper-a-pitch.md as "Figure 3 prediction" in Phase 1 section. No approval needed — this is a paper design choice.
