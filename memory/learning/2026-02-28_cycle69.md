# 🧠 Cycle #69 — 2026-02-28 10:01
## Action: skip (verified — citation scan + arXiv check)
## Context: Execution-blocked 18h. Meta-board saturated (declared at cycle #63). unblock-request PENDING 8h. Checked for any new evidence before skipping.

## Content

### Citation Trail: FCCT (arXiv:2511.05923)
- Traced all 4 citing papers via Semantic Scholar
- Results: MPR-GUI (GUI agents), MRRE (multilingual reasoning), UrbanLN (urban imagery), CAMA (attention modulation)
- **All 4 are vision/NLP/GUI — zero speech papers**
- **Conclusion:** FCCT is vision-only and has not spawned any speech-specific variants. Speech causal tracing space is still 100% unoccupied by competitors.

### arXiv Feb 28 Status
- Verified at 10:01 AM Taipei: same top 3 papers as cycle #68 (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-speech Feb 1)
- **Feb 28 batch not yet posted** (expected ~14:00 Taipei)

### System State Summary
- Papers read (deep): 14
- Gaps identified: 16
- Paper pitches: 2 ready (A+B, not yet seen by Leo)
- Experiment proposals: 2 in queue (P1, P3)
- unblock-request.md: PENDING since 02:01 AM (8h)
