# 🧠 Cycle #84 — 2026-02-28 17:31
## Action: daily-consolidate
## Context: Day 3 end. arXiv Feb 28 batch = Saturday, no new submissions. Last cycle (#83) was method synthesis (IIT+DAS+pyvene blueprint) 30 min ago. Meta-board saturated. 14 cycles today (cycles #70-83). Hygiene rule (non-negotiable per SKILL.md): every day end → consolidate all cycle notes into 1 digest. High value: prevents context loss between sessions, creates reviewable artifact for Leo.

## Content

Created `2026-02-28-digest.md`:
- 14 cycles consolidated (cycles #70-83)
- New deep reads: T-SAE (ICLR 2026 Oral) + Choi et al. (phonological vector arithmetic)
- New gaps: Gap #17 (temporal audio SAE — i.i.d. frames miss phoneme-level concepts) + Gap #18 (phonological geometry through connector — untested)
- New idea: Research Idea #7 (Audio T-SAE), idea-gate 🟢 GREEN
- New method upgrade: DAS gc(k) = theoretically-grounded grounding_coefficient for Paper A
- Paper pitches updated: B to v0.3 (TCS(F) Temporal Module integrated)
- Experiment proposals: 3 total (added Gap #18 as Priority 0 in experiment-queue.md)
- Priority ranking: first complete 7-idea portfolio ranking produced (cycle #73)

Updated progress.md with one-line summary.

## Day 3 Final Stats
- Papers deep-read: 2 (T-SAE + Choi phonological) → 16 total across 3 days
- Research gaps: 18 total (all OPEN)
- Paper ideas: 7 (all gate-checked or pre-gate)
- Paper pitches: 2 (A + B, both reviewable)
- Experiment proposals: 3 (in experiment-queue.md, sorted Priority 0-5)
- arXiv Feb 28 batch: Saturday → no new submissions expected until Monday

## Micro-reflect
Did this cycle produce value? YES — digest creates Leo-reviewable artifact + prevents context loss between sessions. Clean Day 3 close.

Should next cycle adjust action type? Next cycle should **skip** unless new arXiv batch appears or Leo unblocks. No further synthesis value until execution or new papers.

Insight for Leo: Paper A has a clean 3h experiment on MacBook (DAS gc(k) sweep with pyvene on Whisper-small). The ALME stimuli provide the conflict pairs (57K available). The only missing piece is the venv setup. See experiment-queue.md Priority 1.

## Next: 
Next high-value cycle = **Monday arXiv batch** (Feb 28/Mar 1 submissions appear ~14:00 Mon Taipei) OR Leo unblocks experiments. Until then: skip is correct. Do not continue synthesizing (Q7 threshold rule: synthesis saturation reached).
