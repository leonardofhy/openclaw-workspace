# 🧠 Cycle #126 — 2026-03-01 14:31
## Action: skip (principled — dead zone, all queues empty)
## Context: Sunday 2:31 PM Taipei. arXiv weekend gap (~8.5h to Monday batch ~23:00 Taipei). Execution-blocked 45h. Meta-board 24/24 SATURATED (Q25 closed 30min ago in cycle #125). Meta-burst expired. Weekend Protocol 3/3 options exhausted (cycles #101-102, #106, #108). Citation trails exhausted (cycle #123). All 19 gaps confirmed OPEN (cycle #123 + #125).

## Content: Dead-zone skip — correct per Q24 and Q25 rules

Per Q24: Any cycle whose only output is re-verifying an unchanged state → classify as SKIP. Not logging a fake meta-Q.

Per Q25: Cron label "meta-awareness" = action type is not locked to reflect(meta-awareness). When arXiv empty + execution-blocked + meta saturated, correct action IS skip.

State snapshot (unchanged):
- 19 gaps OPEN ✅
- Paper A window clear (no FCCT speech competitor, 0 causal patching papers)
- 2 paper pitches (A v0.2 + B v0.4) ready for Leo review
- 6 experiment proposals in experiment-queue.md (Priority 0-5)
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md current (cycle #117 timestamp)
- unblock-request.md current (cycle #105 refresh, 44h PENDING)

## Next: SKIP until arXiv Monday batch (~23:00 Taipei Sunday / 14:00 EST Monday) OR Leo unblocks. Resume with `learn` action — per Q25, the cron label does NOT prevent this.
