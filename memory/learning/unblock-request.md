# 🚧 Unblock Request

> Auto-generated by autodidact cycle #53 (2026-02-28 02:01)
> Status: PENDING (awaiting Leo acknowledgment)

## Execution-Blocked Since: 2026-02-27 16:01 (cycle #42)

**Blocked cycles:** #42-#53 (~12 cycles, ~6 hours)  
*(Interruped briefly by meta-audit work at #50-52, but core research still blocked)*

## Unblock Needed

To restart research execution, Leo needs ~15 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Create venv (5 min)
python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env
source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate
pip install nnsight openai-whisper torch

# 2. Get a real speech .wav (any option, pick easiest):
#    A: Download LibriSpeech sample
#    B: Record yourself saying "hello this is a test"
#    C: Drop any .wav in workspace/

# 3. Run validation (2 min)
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py /path/to/speech.wav

# 4. Approve IIT experiment (yes/no — see experiment-queue.md P1)
```

## Next 2 Experiments (once unblocked)

1. **P3: Real speech test** — 5 min, validates Triple Convergence Hypothesis
2. **P1: Triple Convergence IIT** — ~3h MacBook experiment, localizes causal layer

## Also Ready for Leo Review (created overnight, not yet seen)

- 📄 `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md` — "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs" (1-page pitch, abstract draft, 4 experiments, venue comparison)
- 📄 `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` — "AudioSAEBench" (5-category benchmark, novel `gc(F)` metric, MVP scope, execution roadmap)

## ⭐ NEW (cycle #86, 18:31 PM): ARENA Study Recommendation

**Before running the IIT experiment, strongly recommend:**
1. **ARENA [1.3.1] Linear Probes** (3-4h, any GPU/Colab free) — teaches causal patching with probe directions = the exact methodology needed for Paper A DAS-gc(k)
2. **ARENA [1.4.2] SAE Circuits sections 1-2** (2-3h, GPT-2 only) — teaches attribution graphs; `circuit-tracer` library may be the direct tool for Paper A Listen Layer localization

**Colab links:**
- Linear Probes: https://colab.research.google.com/github/callummcdougall/arena-pragmatic-interp/blob/main/chapter1_transformer_interp/exercises/part31_linear_probes/1.3.1_Linear_Probes_exercises.ipynb
- SAE Circuits: https://colab.research.google.com/github/callummcdougall/arena-pragmatic-interp/blob/main/chapter1_transformer_interp/exercises/part42_sae_circuits/1.4.2_SAE_Circuits_exercises.ipynb

This adds ~1 day to start but saves ~6h of experimental debugging. Worth it if Leo has a weekend afternoon.
