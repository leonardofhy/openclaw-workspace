# 🚧 Unblock Request

> Auto-generated by autodidact cycle #53 (2026-02-28 02:01)
> Status: PENDING (awaiting Leo acknowledgment)

## Execution-Blocked Since: 2026-02-27 16:01 (cycle #42)

**Blocked cycles:** #42-#53 (~12 cycles, ~6 hours)  
*(Interruped briefly by meta-audit work at #50-52, but core research still blocked)*

## Unblock Needed

To restart research execution, Leo needs ~15 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Create venv (5 min)
python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env
source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate
pip install nnsight openai-whisper torch

# 2. Get a real speech .wav (any option, pick easiest):
#    A: Download LibriSpeech sample
#    B: Record yourself saying "hello this is a test"
#    C: Drop any .wav in workspace/

# 3. Run validation (2 min)
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py /path/to/speech.wav

# 4. Approve IIT experiment (yes/no — see experiment-queue.md P1)
```

## Next 2 Experiments (once unblocked)

1. **P3: Real speech test** — 5 min, validates Triple Convergence Hypothesis
2. **P1: Triple Convergence IIT** — ~3h MacBook experiment, localizes causal layer
