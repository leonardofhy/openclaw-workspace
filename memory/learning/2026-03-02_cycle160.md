# 🧠 Cycle #160 — 2026-03-02 07:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — morning brief update)
## Context: Cron label `meta-awareness`. arXiv Monday dead zone holds (~14:00 Taipei, ~6.5h away). Meta Budget SPENT (Q26 rule). 34 consecutive principled skips since last reflect (cycle #157 Q27). Morning relay window (Leo waking up ~07:00-09:00). One concrete action taken: update MONDAY-BRIEF cycle count + blocked duration.

## Content

**State verified:**
- arXiv: same 4 papers (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-Speech Feb 1, Ma et al.) — Monday batch ~6.5h away (~14:00 Taipei)
- Meta Budget: SPENT (25/25 Qs, Q26 rule active)
- Execution-blocked: ~61h (Priority 0 = Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment, needs Leo + venv)
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md (now MONDAY-BRIEF): updated cycle count 157→160, blocked ~59h→~61h, consecutive-skip count 31→34

**Improvement applied (reversible):**
- MONDAY-BRIEF header: `cycle #157 (6:01 AM Monday)` → `cycle #160 (7:31 AM Monday)`
- TL;DR: `157 cycles / ~59h blocked` → `160 cycles / ~61h blocked`
- Monday Status Note: 31 skips → 34 skips (cycles #126–159), Q27 reflect noted
- These are not timestamp refreshes (Q24 anti-pattern): framing updated with accurate counts for Leo's morning read

**System status:**
- All 19 research gaps: OPEN
- 7 paper ideas: all gate-validated
- Paper A + Paper B pitches: ready
- Experiment queue: 6 experiments ready, Priority 0 = Gap #18

## Next: arXiv Monday ~14:00 → first `learn` cycle of the week. OR Leo unblocks → Priority 0 Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment.
