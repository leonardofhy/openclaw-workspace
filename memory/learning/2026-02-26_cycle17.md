# 🧠 Cycle #17 — 2026-02-26 23:00
## Action: reflect
## Context: 6 cycles since last reflect (#11 at 19:00). End-of-day. Values.md rule: every 5 cycles → micro-reflect. Day is functionally complete — synthesize before sleep.

## Content: Day 1 Full Arc (evening session: cycles #12-16)

### What was accomplished since last reflect (#11):
| Cycle | Action | Key output |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| #12 | build | whisper_hook_demo.py verified ✅ — Whisper-base layer 3 transition (4.2x norm jump), CKA clusters confirmed |
| #13 | learn | SPIRIT deep read — SAE-guided safety patching synthesis |
| #14 | build | whisper_logit_lens.py verified ✅ — logit-lens for encoder, LIS metric, ~300 lines |
| #15 | learn | Heimersheim & Nanda deep read — denoising ≠ noising, minimal pairs gap |
| #16 | learn | "Behind the Scenes" deep read — delayed specialization, NNsight, Track 3+4 combined paper |

### Cumulative Day 1 Assessment:
**Depth:** 7 deep reads (5 new since reflect #11), 2 scripts built+verified, 1 cheat sheet
**Breadth:** 12+ papers scanned, field mapped
**Knowledge quality:** The 4 core papers (Beyond Transcription, AudioLens, AudioSAE, Heimersheim & Nanda) form a coherent methodological foundation. The "Behind the Scenes" and SPIRIT round out safety and LoRA tracks.

### What's solid:
1. **Triple Convergence Hypothesis** is now supported by 4 independent sources:
   - AudioSAE (layer 6-7 transition)
   - Beyond Transcription (saturation layer)
   - AudioLens (critical layer)
   - whisper_hook_demo.py (our own: layer 3 norm jump + CKA clusters)
   
2. **Research opportunity is crisp**: "Causal AudioLens" = AudioLens + patching → grounding_coefficient. Clear, differentiating, co-authored naturally with 智凱哥.

3. **Methodological foundation**: We know patching best practices (Heimersheim & Nanda) BEFORE writing patching code. This is the right order — rare in student research.

4. **Two tools verified** on local machine. Data pipeline exists. Not just theory.

### What's still open / risks:
1. **Real speech testing**: Both scripts work on synthetic audio. Transition zone behavior on real speech unknown. This is the #1 experimental priority for Day 2.
2. **NNsight vs pyvene decision**: Behind the Scenes uses NNsight for Whisper. Haven't checked NNsight API yet. May be simpler than pyvene for encoder interventions.
3. **Causal Abstraction (Geiger et al.)**: Unread. Needed before writing serious patching experiments. Lower urgency than real speech test, but shouldn't skip.
4. **Grounding coefficient operationalization**: Formula is clear (gc = Δacc_audio / (Δacc_audio + Δacc_text)), but need a task with audio-only vs text-only counterfactuals. AudioCaps or AudioQA with context manipulation needed.

### Insights to flag to Leo:
- **The 7th gap**: "Behind the Scenes" + AudioLens both lack causal patching → Leo can be first to combine Track 3 + Track 4 in one paper with causal claims. This is a clear conference-quality contribution.
- **Minimal pairs claim**: Heimersheim & Nanda validates that all existing audio MI papers use suboptimal corruptions. This is a methodological claim Leo can own → benchmark paper opportunity.
- **NNsight discovery**: New tool, potentially simpler than pyvene for Whisper encoder. Worth checking before committing to pyvene for experiment code.

### Should I adjust goals.md?
No changes needed — goals.md was just updated at 19:00 (cycle #11) with post-deadline priorities. It accurately reflects current state. The emergent Track 3+4 combined paper idea should be noted in knowledge-graph, but goals.md already has both tracks and Interspeech/NeurIPS 2026 as targets.

### Decision for next session:
1. Run whisper_hook_demo.py on real speech (validate transition zone)
2. Check NNsight API briefly (5 min assessment)
3. Read Causal Abstraction (Geiger et al.) — before patching code
4. Optional: Multimodal MI Survey if time permits

## Next: Day 2 should open with real speech experiment. Knowledge is sufficient; time to validate empirically.
