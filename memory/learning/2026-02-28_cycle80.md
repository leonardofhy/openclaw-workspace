# 🧠 Cycle #80 — 2026-02-28 15:31
## Action: learn (new paper scan + field update)
## Context: arXiv Feb 28 batch unusually delayed (still not posted at 15:31 PM). Searched broader MI×Audio queries and found a previously-unscanned paper from October 2025 that's directly relevant to AudioSAEBench competitor map.

## Content

### New Paper Found: Paek et al. (arXiv:2510.23802, NeurIPS 2025 MI Workshop)
**"Learning Interpretable Features in Audio Latent Spaces via Sparse Autoencoders"**
- Authors: Nathan Paek, Yongyi Zang, Qihui Yang, Randal Leistikow
- Venue: NeurIPS 2025 Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop ⭐

**What they do:**
- Train SAEs on audio *generation* model latents (DiffRhythm-VAE, EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
- Learn linear mappings from SAE features → discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, timbre)
- Validate on both continuous (VAE) and discrete (codec) latent spaces
- Analyze how pitch/timbre/loudness *evolve throughout* music generation process

**Key findings:**
- SAEs successfully extract interpretable features from audio generation model latents
- Linear mapping (SAE feature → acoustic property) works for low-level properties
- Demonstrates controllable manipulation via SAE feature steering

**Relationship to Leo's work:**

| Dimension | Paek et al. | Leo's AudioSAEBench |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Model | Audio generative (DiffRhythm, EnCodec) | Speech discriminative (Whisper, HuBERT) |
| Task | Music generation analysis | Speech understanding interpretation |
| Method | SAE → linear acoustic property mapping | SAE → full 5-category benchmark |
| Causal? | No patching, no causal test | ✅ Grounding Sensitivity (gc(F)) = NOVEL |
| Temporal? | Tracks property evolution during generation | TCS(F) metric = Gap #12 |
| Audio-vs-text? | Generation only (no text pathway) | ✅ Track 3 grounding_coefficient |

**Assessment:**
- **NOT a competitor** to Paper B (AudioSAEBench): different modality domain (generation ≠ speech perception), no causal metrics, no grounding sensitivity, no temporal structure
- **IS relevant to AudioSAEBench**: Adds to "audio SAE papers" count — now 5 papers (AudioSAE + Mariotte + AR&D + Plantinga-PD + Paek); all have different scopes
- **Key gap**: None of the 5 papers has causal controllability OR grounding sensitivity metrics — AudioSAEBench gc(F) remains novel
- **NeurIPS MI Workshop confirmation**: Community is interested in audio MI; Leo's paper fits this venue well (Paper B → NeurIPS 2026 D&B Track)

**EnCodec connection:**
- Paek et al. analyze EnCodec latents with SAEs — directly relevant to goals.md Research Question #9: "Neural codec codebook分工 — 哪些對pitch/timbre/清晰度負責？"
- They show it's feasible via SAE decomposition; Leo can extend this to *causal* codec analysis

### arXiv Feb 28 Status
- cs.SD + cs.CL scans: all 5 MI×audio queries = 0 new papers beyond existing set
- Feb 28 batch appears delayed beyond usual ~14:00 Taipei posting time
- **All 17 gaps remain OPEN** — no new competitors found

### Field Map Update
Audio SAE papers: now **5 total**
1. AudioSAE (Aparin et al., EACL 2026) — speech encoder, 12 layers
2. Mariotte et al. (ICASSP 2026) — SSL audio, 4 models, no temporal
3. AR&D (Chowdhury et al., ICASSP 2026) — AudioLLM concept naming
4. Plantinga (PD, 2025) — clinical speech SAE
5. **Paek et al. (NeurIPS 2025 MI Workshop)** ← NEW — audio generation latents

**None of the 5 has: causal patching, grounding sensitivity (gc(F)), or temporal structure.**
AudioSAEBench Paper B gap confirmed by 5-paper survey.

## Next: 
- arXiv Feb 28 batch may post in afternoon/evening — next learn cycle if new papers appear
- Otherwise: reflect or skip
- Unblock-request.md should be relayed to Leo (PENDING since 02:01 AM — 13.5h ago)
