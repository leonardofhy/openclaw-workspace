# 🧠 Cycle #88 — 2026-02-28 19:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness + study-to-experiment bridge)
## Context: Last 3 cycles (ARENA mapping, SAELens recon, SAELens v6 gap) were discovery-only. Meta-awareness cron + 3 consecutive learn/skill-up cycles → force reflect. arXiv Saturday = no new batch. Execution-blocked ~35h. High-value action: synthesize ARENA + SAELens findings into concrete "Leo's first session" plan (zero decision overhead when he opens MacBook).

### Meta State Assessment

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Papers read (deep) | 16 | ✅ Strong |
| Research gaps | 19 | ✅ Rich |
| Paper ideas | 7 | ✅ Full portfolio |
| Experiment queue | 6 items, 0 executed | 🔴 Bottleneck |
| Paper pitches | 2 (A+B) ready | ✅ |
| Meta-board Qs | 6/6 + Q7+Q8 answered | ✅ |
| Leo time needed to unblock | ~15 min | → see below |

### Top Loop Failures (post-#87 assessment)

1. **ARENA gap**: Curriculum mapped (cycle #86) but never translated into "what Leo does on Day 1 of unblock." Leo still has to read ARENA docs himself to know where to start.
2. **SAELens gap**: Library fully mapped (cycle #87), Gap #19 confirmed, but no "how to use SAELens for Whisper" cheat sheet exists yet — if Leo wants to load a SAE, he needs to re-read the docs.
3. **Experiment queue stale**: experiment-queue.md was written at cycle #51. Priority 0 (Gap #18, phonological geometry) was added at cycle #82 but the queue's unblock checklist was NOT updated to include the Choi et al. code clone step.

### System Improvement Applied (reversible, no Leo needed)

**Fix #1: Updated experiment-queue.md unblock checklist** with Gap #18 prerequisite step:
```bash
# Step 0 (NEW — Priority 0 prerequisite):
git clone https://github.com/juice500ml/phonetic-arithmetic /tmp/phonetic-arithmetic
# No GPU needed, just Python + minimal pair .wav stimuli
```

**Fix #2: Created Leo's Day-1 Session Plan** (see below — primary output of this cycle)

### Leo's Day-1 Unblock Session Plan (created this cycle)

> If Leo has 2-3 hours: complete this sequence in order. Each step unlocks the next.

**Block 1 — 15 min: Environment (unlocks all code)**
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env
source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate
pip install nnsight openai-whisper torch
git clone https://github.com/juice500ml/phonetic-arithmetic /tmp/phonetic-arithmetic
```

**Block 2 — 10 min: Real speech validation (unlocks Triple Convergence confidence)**
```bash
# Download a LibriSpeech sample (1 command):
curl -sL "https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/dev-other.tar.gz" | tar xz --strip-components=5 -C /tmp/ --wildcards "*.flac" 2>/dev/null | head -1
# OR: record any 5-10s English sentence to /tmp/test.wav
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py /tmp/test.wav
# Expected: CKA clusters separate clearly at layer 3; norm jump sharper than with sine wave
```

**Block 3 — 30 min: ARENA Linear Probes exercise (builds Paper A methodology)**
- Open: `https://arena-chapter1-transformers.streamlit.app/` → Chapter 1.3 → "Linear Probes"
- Focus on: causal probing (not just correlation) → this IS the DAS/gc(k) method backbone
- After: you can implement `voicing_direction = h([d]) - h([t])` probe without docs lookup

**Block 4 — 60 min: Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18, phonological geometry)**
- Uses: Choi et al. code + NNsight
- Run voicing vector arithmetic in Whisper encoder → confirm linearity
- If feasible locally: run connector hook on DeSTA2 (small, MacBook-usable)
- Output: "phonological geometry survives connector" YES/NO → Paper A Figure 2

**Block 5 — 20 min: Review Paper A + Paper B pitches**
- `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md` — read abstract draft + Figure 2 sketch
- `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` — read MVP scope + AudioSAEBench v0.4 protocol
- Decide: confirm NeurIPS 2026 (May) as target for Paper A

### Meta-Board Q9: ARENA Integration Rule (new question identified)

**Problem:** ARENA exercises are a high-value skill-up path, but there's no rule for *when* to do ARENA vs *when* to read papers.

**Proposed rule (reversible):**
> When execution-blocked AND meta-board saturated AND arXiv batch ≥4h away:
> → Spend 1 cycle on **ARENA exercise** (implementation practice, not just mapping)
> → Priority order: [1.3.1] Linear Probes → [1.4.2] SAE Circuits → [2.1] IIT exercises

**Not applied yet** — needs Leo to confirm ARENA access is available from Leo's side (ARENA requires browser; cron session has no browser). Added as Q9 to meta-board below.

### System Health: 2026-02-28 19:31

- Execution-blocked: 35h (since overnight #50)
- unblock-request.md: PENDING 17.5h
- arXiv Saturday batch: confirmed NO (weekend, next Monday ~14:00 Taipei)
- Skip guard: healthy (no consecutive execution-blocked skips since cycle #67)
- Meta-board: 8/8 questions answered + Q9 identified (new)
- **Recommendation: This is the last meta cycle today.** Next high-value cycle = Monday arXiv batch OR Leo unblock.

---

## Next: 
arXiv Monday Feb 28 → March 2 batch at ~14:00 Taipei. OR Leo unblocks → immediately run Priority 0 experiment (phonological geometry test, 2h). If neither by Sunday evening → 1 ARENA-adjacent skill cycle (read [1.3.1] probing exercise description to pre-digest for Leo).
