# 🧠 Cycle #86 — 2026-02-28 18:31
## Action: skill-up (ARENA curriculum mapping)
## Context: Saturday evening. arXiv no weekend batch. Meta-board saturated. Execution-blocked 40h. Cycle #85 surfaced ARENA alignment-science branch with new exercises directly relevant to Leo's skill gaps. High-value action: map the actual curriculum content to Leo's research portfolio so he can study efficiently — no GPU required, and this dramatically improves experiment quality before running Paper A's IIT experiment.

### Exercise Set Priority for Leo (ordered by research impact)

#### 🥇 Priority 1: `[1.3.1] Linear Probes`
**URL:** https://colab.research.google.com/github/callummcdougall/arena-pragmatic-interp/blob/main/chapter1_transformer_interp/exercises/part31_linear_probes/1.3.1_Linear_Probes_exercises.ipynb

**Covers:**
1. Extract hidden state activations + PCA visualization → truth is linearly separable
2. Train MM (difference-of-means) probes vs LR (logistic regression) probes
3. **Causal interventions** — activation patching with probe directions to flip predictions
4. Probing for deception (Apollo Research method)
5. **Attention probes** — single learned query vector over full sequence; beats last-token/mean-pool

**Key insight:** MM probes find MORE causally implicated directions than LR probes (despite lower classification accuracy). This is directly relevant to Leo's grounding_coefficient — the causal version matters more than the predictive version.

**Models used:** `meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf` (needs HF token + gated model access) — but concept applies to any model. MacBook may be slow but feasible with smaller variants.

**Direct relevance to Leo's research:**
- Section 3 (causal interventions) = backbone of Paper A's patching methodology
- Attention probe = directly applicable to audio token positions (which audio frames are diagnostically important?)
- DAS (learned linear subspace) from Paper A gc(k) is a natural extension of MM probe approach
- **Methodology transfer**: Leo can apply "attention probe on audio frame positions" to ask "which frames drive the model's response?" — directly operationalizes Listen vs Guess per audio segment

**Estimated time:** 3-4h (Colab). Can use smaller models than LLaMA-13B (GPT-2 for concept validation).

#### 🥇 Priority 2: `[1.4.2] SAE Circuits` (Attribution Graphs)
**URL:** https://colab.research.google.com/github/callummcdougall/arena-pragmatic-interp/blob/main/chapter1_transformer_interp/exercises/part42_sae_circuits/1.4.2_SAE_Circuits_exercises.ipynb

**4 sections:**
1. **Latent Gradients** — latent-to-latent, token-to-latent, latent-to-logit gradients → linear proxy for how SAE features in different layers communicate
2. **Transcoders** — variant of SAEs that reconstruct MLP layer computation (not just activations); "blind case study" using only weights
3. **Attribution graphs** — from scratch implementation using Gemma 3-1B + GemmaScope 2 transcoders; full Anthropic circuit-tracing methodology
4. **`circuit-tracer` library** — use Anthropic's published tool; Dallas/Austin two-hop factual recall circuit; feature swapping; generation with interventions

**Core papers replicated:**
- "Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in LMs" (Anthropic, 2025) — the methodology paper behind Claude biology work
- "Transcoders Find Interpretable LLM Feature Circuits" (Dunefsky et al., 2024)
- SAELens library + TransformerLens

**Key insight for Leo:** Attribution graphs = the "Audio IOI" (Track 1) methodology. The ARENA exercise builds this from scratch, then uses `circuit-tracer` library. Leo needs this for Track 1 (Audio Causal Benchmark). Also: latent-to-latent gradients = direct tool for AudioSAEBench cross-layer feature connectivity analysis.

**Direct relevance to Leo's research:**
- Track 1 (Audio IOI) uses exactly this methodology (circuit-level analysis)
- Paper B (AudioSAEBench) Category 4 (Causal Controllability) uses SAE steering from this
- `circuit-tracer` = ready-made tool; once Leo learns it on text, audio extension is ~2h of adaptation
- Transcoders: understanding MLP computation decomposition → Track 4 (LoRA mechanistic analysis)

**Models used:** GPT-2 (sections 1-2) + Gemma 2-2B + GemmaScope (sections 3-4). Colab Pro or A100.

**Estimated time:** 4-6h (Colab Pro recommended for sections 3-4)

---

#### 🥈 Priority 3: `[4.1] Emergent Misalignment`
**Direct relevance to Track 4 (LoRA/adapter mechanistic interp):**
- Studies LoRA finetunes that produce misalignment
- "What does fine-tuning change mechanistically?" = exact research question of Track 4
- Uses TransformerLens + SAEs on finetuned models
- Methods: model organisms, autoraters, behavioral evaluation

**Estimated time:** 3-4h (Colab)

---

#### 🥈 Priority 4: `[1.3.4] Activation Oracles`
- Model diffing exercises
- Directly addresses "how to compare two models' internal representations"
- Relevant for Track 4 (compare LoRA-adapted vs base Whisper)
- CKA (we already use this!) is the basis of this exercise

### Recommended Study Path for Leo (before IIT experiment)

```
1. [1.3.1] Linear Probes (3-4h, any GPU or Colab free) 
   → Learn: probe training, causal patching with probe directions, MM vs LR
   → THEN: design Paper A's DAS-gc(k) as a "parameterized probe + causal validation"

2. [1.4.2] SAE Circuits sections 1-2 (2-3h, GPT-2 only)
   → Learn: latent-to-latent gradients, feature circuits, transcoders
   → THEN: implement Track 1 (Audio IOI) using circuit-tracer

3. Run IIT experiment (Priority 1 in experiment-queue.md)
   → Now armed with probe methodology + patching methodology from ARENA
```

**Why this order matters:** Doing ARENA first = run the IIT experiment ONCE correctly, rather than 3 iterations debugging methodology. Estimated net time savings: ~6h experimental work.

### New Synthesis: ARENA `circuit-tracer` + Paper A Connection

The `circuit-tracer` library (Anthropic, 2025) is directly applicable to Leo's Paper A:
- Paper A needs to localize "Listen Layer" = the layer where audio info is causally consulted
- circuit-tracer does exactly this for text models
- **Audio extension approach:** swap text token embeddings → audio frame embeddings in the input graph
- The ARENA [1.4.2] exercise builds this from scratch first → Leo understands the algorithm → extension to audio is a natural ~2h adaptation

This connection was not obvious from cycle #85's radar note — the full exercise structure reveals that `circuit-tracer` is not just "related" but potentially the **direct implementation tool** for Paper A's core methodology.

### New Tool Note: SAELens
The SAE Circuits exercise uses `sae_lens` (SAELens library) for loading pre-trained SAEs — this is the production library for SAE research, better than building from scratch. Check if SAELens has any pre-trained SAEs for Whisper/HuBERT before writing custom SAE training code.

## Next
- **Cycle #87:** arXiv scan or skip (Saturday evening, no batch expected)
- **Leo's updated action queue:** Add ARENA study as **pre-experiment step** before IIT experiment
