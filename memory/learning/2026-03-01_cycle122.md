# 🧠 Cycle #122 — 2026-03-01 12:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — pre-pause-expiry check)
## Context: Meta-burst 4h pause expires ~13:01 (30 min from now). arXiv verified: same 3 papers as last scan (weekend gap holds). Execution-blocked 45h. Meta-board 22/22 saturated. Q21 (conditional cadence) PENDING Leo approval since cycle #112 (~3.5h ago). Cron label = meta-awareness, correct action.

## Content:

### arXiv verification (final Sunday check)
- `mechanistic interpretability + speech`: AR&D (Feb 24), Kawamura (Feb 16), Brain-to-Speech (Feb 1) — same as cycle #120/121. No new papers.
- Weekend gap confirmed. Monday batch expected ~14:00 Taipei = ~26h from now.

### Meta-burst pause status
- Pause started ~09:01, expires ~13:01 (~30 min remaining)
- 6 meta cycles (#109-114) during burst: 4/6 genuine value (67% ✅)
- After expiry: revert to principled skip cadence until arXiv Monday OR Leo unblock

### One genuine improvement: Q21 crystallization
Q21 (conditional cadence rule: 2h intervals when arXiv-weekend + execution-blocked + meta-board-saturated) has been PENDING Leo since cycle #112 (08:31 AM). 

**Cost analysis summary (from cycle #112):**
- Current dead zone: cycles #109-122 = 14 cycles × $0.03/cycle ≈ $0.42 total
- Of that: ~50% (~$0.21) = principled skips/brief verifications with near-zero value
- Conditional 2h cadence would save ~50% compute in dead zones, no information loss
- Risk: Leo may want the regular heartbeat for monitoring purposes even in dead zones

**Recommendation for Leo:**
> ✅ Approve Q21 conditional cadence rule: when ALL 3 hold simultaneously (arXiv weekend gap + execution-blocked ≥12h + meta-board saturated), autodidact can skip to 2h cadence until one condition changes. This saves ~$0.20-0.30 per dead-zone weekend without information loss.

This is a self-modification (cadence change) → requires Leo approval per SKILL.md.

### System readiness snapshot (12:31 PM Sunday)
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: ✅ current (updated cycle #120)
- unblock-request.md: ✅ current (updated cycle #105/108)
- Paper pitches: A v0.2 ✅, B v0.4 ✅
- experiment-queue.md: ✅ P0-P7 ranked with unblock checklist
- meta-board: 22/22 Qs (count-saturated)

No new actions required. System at maximum Sunday readiness.

## Next: Meta-burst pause expires ~13:01 → principled skip cadence. Resume LEARN at arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei OR Leo unblock (Priority 0: Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment).
