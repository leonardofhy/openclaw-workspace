# 🧠 Cycle #95 — 2026-02-28 23:01
## Action: daily-consolidate
## Context: Day 3 end (23:01 PM Saturday). Cycle #94 was reflect at 22:31 PM; digest existed from cycle #84 but missing cycles #91-94. Meta-board saturated (10/10), arXiv empty (Saturday), execution-blocked. Final consolidation of Day 3 is the right end-of-day action.

## Content:
- Added cycles #91-94 addendum to `memory/learning/2026-02-28-digest.md`:
  - Cycle #91: Biology of LLM pre-digest (distributed audio features → NNsight confirmed over CLT)
  - Cycle #92: Paper A v0.2 method upgrade (5 improvements: DAS gc(k) + MMProbe + sweep pattern + NNsight choice + Choi stimuli)
  - Cycle #93: Neuronpedia + SAELens pre-digest (Paper B infrastructure + Gap #19 viz tool)
  - Cycle #94: Q10 closed (MVP viz = librosa PNG, no build needed), meta-board 10/10 SATURATED
- Added FINAL stats table (Day 1/2/3/Total cross-table)
- Added Day 4 morning queue (8 prioritized items with unblock commands)
- Updated progress.md: cycle #95 row + corrected Day 3 Final Stats block

## Day 3 Summary (3-line format):
- **Read:** 2 deep (T-SAE + Choi phonological) + 6+ scanned; total 16 deep / 33+ scanned across 3 days
- **Gaps/Ideas:** +6 gaps (#14-19) + Idea #7 (Audio T-SAE 🟢) + 3 experiment proposals; Paper A v0.2 FULLY SPECIFIED
- **System:** 4 ARENA pre-digests, 8 meta improvements, meta-board 10/10 SATURATED; execution-blocked 45h (awaiting Leo)

## Next: 
- Day 4 (Sunday Feb 29 → actually Monday March 2 — Feb only has 28 days in 2026)
- arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei → cycle #96 = learn (arXiv scan)
- If Leo unblocks → Priority 0 (venv) → Priority 1 (IIT Whisper-small) → Priority 2 (Listen Layer Qwen2-Audio)
- No high-value action until arXiv opens or Leo unblocks
