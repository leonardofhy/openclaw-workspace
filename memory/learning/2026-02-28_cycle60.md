# 🧠 Cycle #60 — 2026-02-28 05:31
## Action: learn (citation scan)
## Context: 1 skip since last cycle (#59 at 5:01 AM). arXiv Feb 28 batch not available (~8.5h). Executed citation trail check on AudioLens (arXiv:2506.05140) to verify gap coverage is still clean.

## Content

**AudioLens citation check (Semantic Scholar):**
- 3 papers cite AudioLens:
  1. Cascade Equivalence (2602.17598) — already deep-read cycle #40 ✅
  2. ESNs paper (2601.03115) — already deep-read cycle #25 ✅
  3. **NEW (scanned): arXiv:2511.10045 "Do LMs Associate Sound with Meaning?"** — Sound symbolism + LEX-ICON dataset, layer-wise attention fractions on phonemes in MLLMs. Nov 2025. **SKIP (low relevance):** behavioral/attention-based, not causal; studies phonetic iconicity not grounding attribution; uses attention fraction scores not patching → doesn't close Leo's gap.

**arXiv search:** Two keyword queries attempted, 0 new relevant results.

**Field status confirmation:** No paper in the literature tests causal layer-wise audio grounding (the "Listen Layer" contribution). Leo's gap remains open.

**Meta-note:** unblock-request.md is still PENDING. Real speech test + venv remain the bottleneck. Leo wakes up ~8-9 AM — ~2.5h from now.

## Next: Skip until arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 Taipei) or Leo wakes up and initiates real speech test / IIT experiment approval
