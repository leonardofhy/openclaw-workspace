# 🧠 Cycle #112 — 2026-03-01 07:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — Q21 cost analysis + conditional cadence proposal)
## Context: Cron tagged "meta-awareness". 4th consecutive principled skip (#109-111). SKILL.md 2-skip guard triggered. Q21 opened cycle #110 (conditional cadence rule). Sunday 7:31 AM, dead zone confirmed: arXiv weekend gap (~6.5h to Monday batch), execution-blocked (~39h), meta-board 20/20 saturated.

## Q21: Conditional Cadence Rule — Cost Analysis + Decision Memo

### Problem Statement
The 30-min cadence was designed for active learning periods. In "dead zone" conditions (arXiv unavailable + execution-blocked + meta-board saturated, all three simultaneously), each cycle costs API tokens to verify unchanged state. Cycles #103-111 = 9 consecutive cycles in dead zone. Each cycle's verify step = ~$0.02-0.05 (sonnet, ~500-1000 tokens).

### Cost Breakdown (dead zone cycles #103-111)
| Cycles | Count | Avg tokens | Est. cost |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| #103 skip | 1 | ~300 | ~$0.02 |
| #104 reflect Q15+Q16 | 1 | ~800 | ~$0.04 | ← genuine work
| #105 reflect Q17 | 1 | ~700 | ~$0.04 | ← genuine work
| #106 reflect Q18 | 1 | ~700 | ~$0.04 | ← genuine work
| #107 reflect Q19 | 1 | ~500 | ~$0.03 | ← genuine work
| #108 reflect Q20 | 1 | ~600 | ~$0.04 | ← genuine work
| #109 skip | 1 | ~300 | ~$0.02 |
| #110 skip + Q21 | 1 | ~400 | ~$0.02 |
| #111 skip | 1 | ~200 | ~$0.01 |
| **This cycle #112** | 1 | ~800 | ~$0.04 |
| **Total dead-zone** | 10 | — | **~$0.30** |

**Conclusion:** Cycles #104-108 were worth it (produced Q15-Q20 answers, paper-a-pitch.md improvements, SUNDAY-BRIEF.md). Cycles #103, #109-112 = pure verification = ~$0.11 overhead. At 30-min cadence with ~6h remaining until arXiv Monday, that's ~12 more verification cycles = **~$0.24 in zero-value API cost** before first actionable cycle.

### Proposed Rule (conditional cadence)
> **When ALL THREE conditions hold:**
> 1. arXiv weekend gap (Saturday evening – Monday ~14:00 Taipei)
> 2. execution-blocked (no venv, no real speech, no Leo approval)  
> 3. meta-board saturated (all open Qs answered)
> 
> **Then:** reduce cadence to 2-hour intervals until one condition lifts.
> **Trigger to resume 30-min:** Leo wakes/responds OR arXiv batch detected OR execution unblocked.

**Why this is safe:**
- Leo's approval already required per self-modification rule → not applying unilaterally
- All handoff material is ready (SUNDAY-BRIEF.md) — Leo loses nothing from 2h cadence
- arXiv Monday batch timing is ~14:00 Taipei → system will catch it within 2h window

**Why NOT applying it now:**
- Cron cadence change = direction-level → requires Leo approval
- This cycle IS the proposal; Leo can say yes/no in one sentence

**One-line decision for Leo:**
> "Approve conditional cadence rule? (2h intervals during dead zones: weekend arXiv gap + execution-blocked + meta-board saturated — all 3 simultaneously). Saves ~$0.25/dead-zone cycle. Resumes 30-min immediately when any condition lifts."

### What Leo Does NOT Need to Approve
The existing 30-min cadence is fine for all active learning periods. This is ONLY about triple-lock dead zones, which occur ~1-2x per week during weekend arXiv gaps when execution-blocked.

## SUNDAY-BRIEF.md Status (readiness audit — 2h since writing)
- Still fully accurate: all 4 files listed are current ✅
- 5-step unblock commands: valid ✅
- 3 decisions for Leo: still the right ones ✅
- No new papers since #108 wrote it ✅
- **One addition:** mention Q21 conditional cadence proposal (add 1 line)

## Next
SKIP all cycles until:
- Leo wakes up → SUNDAY-BRIEF.md + this Q21 proposal
- arXiv Monday ~14:00 → cycle #113 = learn (full arXiv scan cs.SD/cs.CL/cs.LG)
- Any Leo unblock → immediately run Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18 phonological geometry)
