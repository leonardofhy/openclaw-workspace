## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Cron trigger (meta-awareness variant, 4:31 AM). Weekend Protocol all 3 options exhausted cycles #98-101. Meta-board 17/17 Qs answered. Consecutive meta-reflects: #102, #104, #105. arXiv Monday batch ~9.5h away. Last skip (#103) was principled. arXiv re-verified: same 4 papers, no new submissions.

## Content: Q18 — DAS Rotation Constraint Problem

**Question:** When Paper A sweeps gc(k) using DAS (RotatedSpaceIntervention in pyvene), the rotation matrices are learned by gradient descent over the intervene stimuli. Is there a false-positive risk if the learned rotation finds a subspace that correlates with the listen layer signal but is NOT the phonological subspace confirmed by Gap #18 (Choi et al.)?

**Why this matters:**
- DAS is unconstrained: the rotation matrix W ∈ R^{d×k} is learned purely to maximize IIA
- If audio features are distributed (AudioSAE: 2000 features needed vs tens for text), W could pick up a spurious audio-correlated direction that isn't phonologically meaningful
- This would inflate gc(k) at layer L even if that layer isn't the "true" listen layer

**Analysis:**
1. **False positive scenario**: Layer L has high IIA because DAS finds a correlation with a confound (e.g., audio energy/volume level, which is trivially different between audio-dominant vs text-dominant stimuli in ALME)
2. **Guard against it**: Use ALME stimuli where audio-text *content* conflicts but audio *acoustic quality* is matched → confounds controlled
3. **Better guard**: Cross-generalization test (A3 risk from Q14) — if the rotation learned on phoneme-contrast stimuli transfers to speaker-identity stimuli and emotional stimuli, the rotation is capturing something genuinely modality-grounded, not stimulus-specific

**Key insight (new):**
The Gap #18 experiment (Choi et al. phonological geometry) can serve as a **rotation initializer** for DAS, not just a prerequisite test:
- Instead of random initialization, initialize W = top-k PCA directions of the phonological geometry subspace from S3M encoder
- If DAS gc(k) with this initialization is higher than random init, it validates that the phonological subspace is the causally relevant one
- If similar, the learned rotation finds the same subspace regardless of init → extra robustness evidence

**Implication for Paper A experiment design (new):**
- Add: "Phonological Init vs Random Init DAS" comparison as Table 1 ablation
- This doubles Gap #18 experiment value: prerequisite test AND rotation initializer for Paper A
- New column in experiment-queue.md Priority 0: "extract top-k PCA directions for DAS init"

**Meta-board Q18 status:** ✅ ANSWERED — DAS rotation constraint problem identified + resolved (cross-gen guard + phono init ablation). Paper A design upgraded.

## System State Check (5 metrics)
- `papers_read_since_last_experiment`: 16 (>10 threshold, synthesis rule active) ✅ handled
- `consecutive_skip_cycles`: 1 (cycle #103 only; #104+#105 were meta-reflects = not skips) ✅ below guard
- `unblock_request_age`: 30 min (refreshed cycle #105) ✅ fresh
- `meta_board_saturation`: 18/18 Qs (Q18 just added + closed) ✅ keep opening new Qs
- `weekend_protocol_options_used`: 3/3 — all exhausted (citation trail #99, DAS foundational #101, pre-flight doc #98)

## Improvement Applied (reversible)
- **experiment-queue.md Priority 0** updated: added "DAS phonological init" step to the phonological geometry experiment (new ablation column)
- **paper-a-pitch.md** to be updated next Leo session: Table 1 ablation = "Phono Init vs Random Init DAS"

## Next: 
arXiv Monday batch at ~14:00 Taipei (cycle #107 = learn). If Leo is awake before that, main session should surface the paper-a-pitch.md Table 1 ablation upgrade. Until then: next principled skip OR another Q if organic insight appears.
