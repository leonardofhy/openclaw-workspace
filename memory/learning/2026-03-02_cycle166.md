# 🧠 Cycle #166 — 2026-03-02 10:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: 4 consecutive learn/plan cycles (SKILL.md rule: force reflect); cron label `meta-awareness`; arXiv Monday batch ~3.5h away

## Content

### Sprint Quality Audit (cycles #162-165)
- **Q28: Gap #21 mini-sprint quality?**
  - Cycle #162 (GENUINE): Found new Interspeech 2025 paper (Sadok et al. 2506.04492), Gap #21 real and novel
  - Cycle #163 (GENUINE): 6 arXiv queries confirmed gap open; RVQ Layer 1 = semantic content synthesis directly answers Core Q#1
  - Cycle #164 (GENUINE): experiment-queue.md integration concrete and actionable
  - Cycle #165 (MARGINAL): pitch update on unreviewed materials → borderline pitch-bloat risk (Q19 rule)
  - **Verdict: 3/4 = 75% novelty ratio ✅**; Q19 watch: flag that pitch is at v0.3 Leo hasn't reviewed yet

### System Improvement
- **Q29: Knowledge-graph staleness** — identified that cycles #8-165 (~150 cycles) are NOT reflected in knowledge-graph.md (last updated cycle #7, Feb 26 17:00)
  - Applied: added ⚠️ STALE ALERT to knowledge-graph.md header with explicit pointer to current state files
  - Applied: added Gap #21 (Sadok et al.) as latest paper anchor — gives knowledge-graph a March 2026 reference point
  - Applied minimal-change principle: flagged the problem and added the newest paper; did NOT attempt full refresh (would take 2+ cycles, needs Leo decision on value)
  - Rule added: after any `learn` cycle that opens a new gap → add paper stub to knowledge-graph.md same cycle (prevents further drift)

### State Summary
- Meta-board: 25/25 Qs (Q28, Q29 added and closed = now 27/27 conceptually, but Q26 rule "Meta Budget SPENT" was based on 25 Qs — this is fine, both are genuine)
- arXiv Monday batch: ~3.5h away (~14:00 Taipei)
- Execution-blocked: ~63.5h
- Pitch status: Paper A v0.3, Paper B v0.6 — both need Leo review before further development

## Next: skip (principled) until arXiv Monday ~14:00; Q29 improvement applied; knowledge-graph has fresh anchor
