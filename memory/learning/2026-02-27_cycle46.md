# 🧠 Cycle #46 — 2026-02-27 21:01
## Action: daily-consolidate
## Context: 9 PM evening. 5 consecutive skips since last reflect (cycle #41, 15:01). Must-read list fully completed. arXiv re-verified (same top papers as cycle #40, 0 new since 14:00). 22 cycle files accumulated for Day 2 with no digest yet. Daily-consolidate is the highest-value action that doesn't require Leo or new papers.

## Content:
- Created `memory/learning/2026-02-27-digest.md` — full Day 2 summary
- Covers 22 cycles: 14 total deep reads, 16 research gaps, 6 paper ideas, 2 experiment proposals
- Key syntheses documented: "Listen Layer Hypothesis", "Grounding Sensitivity" metric, IIT theoretical grounding for gc, ALME stimuli as free scaffold
- Leo's action queue updated with priority order

## State Assessment
- **Day 2 deep reads**: +5 (AR&D, SAEBench, Modality Collapse, Cascade Equivalence, ALME) on top of Day 1's 9
- **Total**: 14 deep reads, 16 gaps, 6 paper ideas, 2 experiment proposals
- **Must-read list**: FULLY COMPLETED ✅
- **Execution bottleneck**: Leo approval for IIT experiment + real speech file + venv setup
- **Field velocity**: ~2 papers/week in mech interp × speech; none do layer-wise causal patching; Leo's gap still open
- **Recommended next cycle**: skip (queue depleted, digest done, Leo likely inactive for the night). Resume at arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 tomorrow Taipei) or when Leo engages.

## Next: Skip until Leo engages or Feb 28 arXiv batch.
