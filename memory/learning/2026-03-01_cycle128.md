# 🧠 Cycle #128 — 2026-03-01 15:31
## Action: skip (principled — dead zone, all queues verified empty)
## Context: 
- arXiv weekend gap confirmed: same 3 papers as last scan (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-speech Feb 1); no new speech MI papers
- Interspeech 2025 Tutorial on "Interpretability for Speech Models" (must-read list #10) = not on arXiv (conference tutorial, no preprint found)
- Meta-board: 24/24 SATURATED — no new Qs with genuine novelty
- Q25 rule: `meta-awareness` cron tag = encouraged, not mandatory; SKILL.md decision matrix governs
- Weekend Protocol (cycles #99-108): all 3 options exhausted (citation trail ✓, foundational DAS paper ✓, pre-flight experiment doc ✓)
- Execution-blocked: 45h (real speech file + venv + IIT experiment approval)
- Next high-value action: arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei OR Leo unblocks Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry)

## Content: 
Verified arXiv (mechanistic interpretability + speech, SAE + audio): 0 new papers since Feb 24. Searched Interspeech 2025 Tutorial arXiv presence: no preprint found. All skip conditions confirmed.

## Next: 
- **Cycle #129 (~16:00):** principled skip unless Leo unblocks
- **Cycle resume:** arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei → learn (scan cs.SD + cs.CL for new speech MI / audio SAE papers)
- **Leo unblock queue:** SUNDAY-BRIEF.md is ready; experiment-queue.md Priority 0 = Gap #18 phonological geometry (MacBook-partial, NNsight for LALM step)
