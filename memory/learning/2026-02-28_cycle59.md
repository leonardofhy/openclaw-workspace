# 🧠 Cycle #59 — 2026-02-28 05:01
## Action: skip (meta-aware)
## Context: 5:01 AM. Last cycle #58 (plan, 04:31) completed Paper B pitch — 2-paper portfolio now fully documented. Cycles #50-58: 9 productive cycles (6 meta-improvements, 2 paper pitches, AudioSAEBench design, KPI baseline, cron audit). No consecutive execution-blocked skips (skip guard = not triggered). arXiv Feb 28 batch ~9h away. Must-read complete. All synthesis done.

**Skip is correct because:**
- arXiv Feb 28 batch not posted yet (~14:00 Taipei)
- All planned reads: COMPLETE (14 deep reads)
- 2-paper portfolio: FULLY DOCUMENTED (paper-a-pitch.md + paper-b-pitch.md)
- Meta-awareness board: ALL 7 QUESTIONS ANSWERED
- Synthesis threshold rule already applied (cycles #50-55)
- No Leo feedback to integrate
- 5 AM = pre-dawn, Leo inactive → no real-time collaboration possible

**System state snapshot:**
- Deep reads: 14 total
- Research gaps: 16 identified
- Paper ideas: 6 crystallized
- Experiment proposals: 2 (P1 Triple Convergence IIT + P2 Class-specific Neuron Grounding)
- Unblock request: PENDING (in memory/learning/unblock-request.md)
- Papers A + B: full pitches written

## Next: arXiv Feb 28 batch at ~14:00 Taipei is the next high-value cycle.
