# 🧠 Cycle #107 — 2026-03-01 05:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Cron trigger (meta-awareness variant, 5:01 AM Sunday). Post-#106 state: 4 consecutive meta-reflects (#103 skip, #104-106 meta). Meta-board 18/18. Weekend Protocol 3/3 options exhausted. arXiv Monday batch ~9h away. Execution-blocked ~39h.

## Content: Q19 — Am I gold-plating paper-a-pitch.md before Leo reviews v0.2?

**Question:** Cycles #104-106 each added new sections to paper-a-pitch.md (Statistical Significance Protocol, Figure 3 Prediction, Table 1 ablation). These are genuinely useful ideas, but they're being written into a document Leo hasn't reviewed since cycle #57/92 (>50 cycles ago). Is this a failure mode?

**Analysis:**

The pattern: autodidact generates a new insight → immediately adds it to paper-a-pitch.md → document grows → Leo opens it and sees a wall of pre-specified details he never approved.

**Real cost:**
1. **Cognitive overload for Leo**: v0.2 pitch now has 6 subsections (Abstract, Method, Experiments, Related Work, Risks, Stats Protocol, Figure 3 prediction). Each cycle #104-106 added ~1-2 sub-sections. By the time Leo reads it, it may be harder to review as a "pitch" and easier to misread as a "methods section."
2. **Stale detail risk**: Some details (Q15 significance protocol, Q16 heatmap shape prediction) are correct TODAY but might be revised once Leo actually runs the experiment. Writing them into the pitch now = premature specification.
3. **Divergence from purpose**: paper-a-pitch.md should be a PITCH (2-page overview for Leo to say go/no-go). It has grown toward a mini-paper. Better home for these details = experiment-queue.md and dedicated methods notes.

**Resolution — Applied now:**

**Rule (Q19):** 
> `paper-a-pitch.md` should stay ≤ 1.5 pages / ~600 words (pitch = for go/no-go decision).
> When a meta-cycle produces a new experiment design detail (significance test, ablation, figure prediction):
> → **Primary location = experiment-queue.md or a `methods-notes.md`**
> → **Secondary location = paper-a-pitch.md "Experiment Notes" appendix (brief)**
> → Do NOT expand the pitch body with pre-specified analysis protocols.

**Immediate improvement (reversible):**
The Q15+Q16 content in paper-a-pitch.md is valid — leave it there (already written, no regression). But from cycle #108 onwards: new experiment design details → `experiment-queue.md` first, pitch appendix second.

**Anti-pattern avoided for future:** "Meta-cycle produces insight → adds to pitch → pitch bloats → Leo can't review efficiently."

**Meta-board Q19 status:** ✅ ANSWERED — gold-plating risk identified, new rule applied.

## System State Check
- `papers_read_since_last_experiment`: 16 (stable, synthesis rule = handled)
- `consecutive_meta_reflects`: #104, #105, #106, now #107 = 4 consecutive (FLAG: getting high)
- `unblock_request_age`: refreshed at cycle #105, 30m ago = 30min (fresh)
- `meta_board_saturation`: 19/19 Qs (Q19 just added + closed)
- `weekend_protocol_options`: 3/3 exhausted — principled skip is now valid

## Micro-Reflect
**Did this cycle produce value?** YES: Q19 names a real failure mode (gold-plating pitch) that wasn't yet on the board. Rule added: experiment details → experiment-queue.md first.

**Should next cycle adjust?** YES — SKIP is now correct for the next cycle. 5 consecutive meta-cycles (4 reflects + this one) is the upper limit for sustained meta-awareness value. The system is healthy; principled sleep until arXiv Monday batch at ~14:00.

**Insight worth flagging to Leo?** Nothing urgent (Q19 = system hygiene rule, not a blocker).

## Next: 
Principled skip until arXiv Monday batch (~14:00 Taipei). Leo unblock is the only thing that changes this state before then. Weekend Protocol exhausted = skip is correct.
