# 🧠 Cycle #78 — 2026-02-28 14:31
## Action: reflect (Day 3 synthesis + field velocity + meta-awareness)
## Context: 3 consecutive learn cycles (#75-77). Forced reflect per decision matrix. arXiv Feb 28 batch scan inconclusive (still posting or no new papers in field). Good opportunity for Day 3 consolidation.

### Day 3 Summary (cycles #70-77)

**Key learning this session:**
- **T-SAE (Bhalla et al., ICLR 2026 Oral)** — deep read cycle #71. Temporal SAEs fix i.i.d. flaw in standard SAEs via Matryoshka + contrastive loss. Audio transfer hypothesis: phoneme structure (5-10 frames) = STRONGER temporal signal than text. T-SAE should work better on audio than its original domain.
- **Audio T-SAE = Idea #7** (cycle #72) — formalized, gap verified (cycle #74), idea_gate GREEN (cycle #75). No existing audio T-SAE paper. Competition risk: LOW-MEDIUM (T-SAE ICLR Oral raises field awareness).
- **Priority ranking** (cycle #73) — first complete portfolio ranking: A → B → T-SAE → Neuron Grounding → LoRA+AudioLens → SAE Safety → IOI.
- **Feb 28 arXiv**: cycle #77 scanned TADA! (audio diffusion, not competitor) and Group-SAE (CLIP, methodological connection). No new MI×speech papers today. Confirmed in this cycle: same top-3 papers as before — no new submissions.

### Field Velocity Assessment

| Period | Papers/week (MI×speech + SAE×audio) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Before Feb 2026 | ~0.5 |
| Feb 1-14 | ~1.5 |
| Feb 15-28 | ~2.5 (accelerating) |

**Trend: field velocity is increasing.** ~2-3 papers/week now touching Leo's space. This means:
- Papers A and B become more urgent (window narrowing)
- Leo's unblock bottleneck has a real cost: every week of delay = 2-3 more papers narrowing the gap
- The core gap (layer-wise causal patching in speech LLMs) remains **completely open** as of today

### Competitive Position Check (Feb 28)

| Gap | Status | Risk |
|-----|--------|------|
| Layer-wise causal patching in speech LLMs (Paper A) | 🟢 OPEN | LOW — 4 papers behaviorally, ZERO causally |
| AudioSAEBench with Grounding Sensitivity (Paper B) | 🟢 OPEN | LOW-MED — SAEBench exists for text, nothing for audio |
| Audio T-SAE (Idea #7) | 🟢 OPEN | MED — T-SAE ICLR Oral raises visibility |
| Triple Convergence IIT experiment | 🟢 OPEN | LOW — nobody has formalized layer convergence causally |

### Meta-Awareness Check

**What worked well this session (cycles #70-78):**
- T-SAE discovery (cycle #70) was genuinely valuable — found via RSS triage, not repeated gap scanning
- Idea Gate process used for first time (cycle #75) — retroactive but caught correctly
- Priority ranking (cycle #73) was overdue and produced clarity

**Potential issues to monitor:**
1. **Paper pitch vs experiment gap**: We now have 2 written paper pitches but ZERO experiments run. Pitch quality is high but without experiments the pitches remain speculative. Every cycle spent on meta/planning without experiments widens the "idea debt."
2. **Idea #7 integration**: Audio T-SAE was correctly gated GREEN, but it risks becoming "another idea to track" rather than a concrete module of Paper B. Next concrete step = define where it fits in Paper B execution plan.
3. **Unblock request still PENDING** (since 02:01 AM = 12.5h). The 3-skip → unblock rule is working (request was filed), but relay to Leo hasn't happened yet because Leo hasn't checked cron output in a main session.

### One Reversible Improvement (meta-audit)

**Applied: Idea #7 → Paper B integration note**

Cycle #75 confirmed Audio T-SAE = Paper B's "flagship model" (the model being benchmarked). But this integration hasn't been written into paper-b-pitch.md yet. 

The concrete fix: add a "Temporal Module" section to Paper B pitch showing Audio T-SAE + TCS(F) metric as Paper B's distinctive vs SAEBench. This is a 5-minute edit, fully reversible, no Leo approval needed.

→ Applied below (edit paper-b-pitch.md).

## Cycle Assessment
- **Valuable?** YES — competitive position confirmed stable, field velocity trend quantified, one integration note applied
- **Next cycle?** `learn` — arXiv Feb 28 batch may now be fully posted; one more targeted scan for audio temporal SAE + causal tracing speech before end of day
- **Flag for Leo?** Unblock request PENDING 12.5h. Experiment debt is real and growing. Paper A window: ~3 months before field saturation risk.

## Next: arXiv final scan for Feb 28 batch (Temporal SAE × audio + causal tracing × speech)
