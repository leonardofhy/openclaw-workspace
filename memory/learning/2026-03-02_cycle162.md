# 🧠 Cycle #162 — 2026-03-02 08:31
## Action: learn
## Context: arXiv dead zone still holds (Monday batch expected ~14:00 Taipei). Semantic Scholar query surfaced an unscanned paper: arXiv:2506.04492 "Bringing Interpretability to Neural Audio Codecs" (Interspeech 2025) — not previously catalogued. Genuine new read, ending the consecutive-skip streak productively.

## Content: "Bringing Interpretability to Neural Audio Codecs" (Sadok, Hauret, Bavu — Univ. Grenoble Alpes / CNAM / French-German ISL, Interspeech 2025)
**arXiv: 2506.04492 | Venue: Interspeech 2025 (Proc.)**

### Problem
Neural audio codecs (DAC, SpeechTokenizer, Mimi, BigCodec) use RVQ to compress audio into discrete tokens. These acoustic tokens drive audio generation but are opaque: their training objective (reconstruction) doesn't enforce interpretability. What speech attributes (content, identity, pitch) are encoded in which codec tokens?

### Method (2-stage)
1. **Analysis stage**: Probe 4 codecs (DAC, SpeechTokenizer, Mimi, BigCodec) via a pretrained AnCoGen-Melspectrogram network. Determines mapping between acoustic tokens and speech attributes (pitch, speaker identity, linguistic content). Two parallel forwards from waveform → compare codec token space vs. mel-spectrogram space.
2. **Synthesis stage**: Train AnCoGen-Codec plugins for DAC + Mimi that directly predict speech attributes from tokens (AND reconstruct tokens from attributes). Enables direct manipulation in token space.

### Key Design Choice: SpeechTokenizer
SpeechTokenizer adds HuBERT semantic teacher → forces RVQ layer 1 to focus on phonetic content; subsequent layers (2+) capture paralinguistic (timbre, prosody). This is the only codec with explicit disentanglement design. DAC + Mimi have implicit/emergent structure.

### Connections to Leo's Work
1. **Gap #9 (Paek et al. = acoustic codecs)**: Paek et al. cycle #80 was EnCodec/DiffRhythm SAEs. THIS paper is analysis without SAEs — complementary. Neither does CAUSAL patching.
2. **AudioSAEBench (Paper B)**: RVQ codebook layers = natural partitioning for SAE evaluation. SpeechTokenizer's explicit semantic/paralinguistic split = ideal model for AudioSAEBench Category 1 (Acoustic Concept Detection) — can validate whether SAE features align with the codec's designed disentanglement.
3. **Track 1 (Audio IOI / Causal Benchmark)**: AnCoGen's attribute→token mapping provides a principled "clean/corrupt" strategy: corrupt only the speaker identity tokens (RVQ layers 2+) while preserving content (RVQ layer 1). Cleaner than white-noise patching.
4. **Gap candidate**: AnCoGen probes attribute → token mappings via correlation/probing. Nobody has done CAUSAL patching on codec token streams ("does zeroing RVQ layer k causally interrupt speaker recognition in a downstream LALM?"). Leo could add this.

### Assessment vs. Goals
- Scope: Encoder-side interpretability of codecs. Does NOT address LALMs or the listen-vs-guess question.
- Method: Probing + AnCoGen network (post-hoc). NOT mechanistic causal patching.
- Gap status: Confirms codec interpretability = active area but all work is PROBE-BASED (not causal). Leo's causal approach still unique.
- Novelty: This is the first paper I've seen to do cross-codec comparison (4 codecs) with attribute probing, and specifically train generative attribute predictors from codec tokens.

### Connection to Core Research Questions
- Q9: "Neural codec codebook division — which codebook layers are responsible for pitch/timbre/clarity?" → This paper DIRECTLY answers for DAC/SpeechTokenizer/Mimi/BigCodec (via probing). SpeechTokenizer layer 1 = content, layers 2+ = acoustic attributes.
- Q2: Codec token corruption = cleaner "clean/corrupt" strategy than white noise → supports Track 1 causal benchmark design.

### Gap Identified
**Gap #20 (soft)**: No CAUSAL patching on neural audio codec token streams in downstream LALM inference. AnCoGen probes correlational attribute→token mappings; nobody has asked "does zeroing RVQ layer k in the LALM input causally interrupt the LALM's understanding of speaker identity?" This would directly connect codec interpretability to Listen vs Guess grounding.

Note: Gap #20 was previously assigned to "Emotion-Modulated Safety" (cycle #100). Renaming this as **Gap #21 (Codec Causal Patching)** to avoid collision.

## Next: arXiv Monday batch expected ~14:00 Taipei — cycle #163 = arXiv learn scan. Monday batch will contain all weekend submissions (likely 20-30+ cs.SD papers).
