# 🧠 Cycle #105 — 2026-03-01 04:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Meta-awareness cron trigger (ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness label). 30 min since cycle #104 (Q15+Q16 closed). Weekend Protocol options all exhausted. Meta-board 16/16 Qs answered. arXiv Monday batch ~10h away. Execution-blocked ~36h.

## Content: System state audit + unblock-request.md refresh

### Situation Assessment
- **Execution-blocked** since cycle #42 (Feb 27, 4 PM) = ~36 hours, ~62 cycles
- **All Weekend Protocol options exhausted** this weekend: citation trail (#99), foundational read DAS (#101), pre-flight doc (#102)
- **Meta-board saturated** through Q16 (Q16 = 2D IIA heatmap shape prediction, closed cycle #104)
- **0 experiments run** despite rich theoretical foundation: 16 deep reads, 19 gaps, 7 ideas, 2 paper pitches
- **arXiv** not posting until ~14:00 Monday Taipei = ~10h away

### Meta-observation: unblock-request.md was STALE
Key finding this cycle: `unblock-request.md` was last written at cycle #53 (Feb 28, 02:01 AM) and had NOT been updated since — despite:
- 50+ additional cycles of work
- Paper pitches A (v0.2 fully specified) and B (v0.4) being written
- DAS statistical protocol (Q15) + Figure 3 prediction (Q16) being added
- Weekend Protocol rule being created

This is a **documentation gap**: the "relay to Leo" document was 52 cycles out of date. Leo might read an outdated briefing.

**Applied improvement:** Rewrote `unblock-request.md` to reflect current state (cycle #105).

### What Changed
- unblock-request.md now shows: 36h blocked (not "6h"), cycle #104+ context (not #53), paper-a-pitch v0.2 features (Q15 bootstrap CI + Q16 heatmap prediction), updated Priority Queue table (P0-P7), corrected venv command (added `pyvene`), reliable LibriSpeech curl URL

### Q17: How often should unblock-request.md be refreshed?
**Question opened this cycle:** The document drifted 52 cycles / ~26h behind. Should it be auto-refreshed every N cycles?

**Answer:** Rule needed:
> When unblock-request.md is PENDING AND its "Last updated" timestamp is >4h old: refresh it in the next meta-awareness cycle.
> This prevents "stale relay" bug where Leo reads outdated unblock summary.

**Status:** ✅ ANSWERED — rule applied now. Update performed this cycle.

### Meta-board status: 17/17 (Q17 opened + closed)

## Next:
- arXiv Monday batch at ~14:00 Taipei (~10h) → cycle N = learn (arXiv scan, cs.SD + cs.CL)
- If Leo wakes up before that → relay unblock-request.md via main session
- After unblock: Priority 0 (phonetic-arithmetic clone) → Priority 1 (IIT experiment)
