# 🧠 Cycle #97 — 2026-03-01 00:01

## Action: skip
## Context: Sunday midnight. arXiv weekend gap (~38h to Monday batch). All queues depleted.

**State check:**
- arXiv: weekend gap — no new papers until Monday ~14:00 Taipei
- Must-read list: FULLY COMPLETED (cycle #22)
- Meta-board: 10/10 SATURATED (cycle #93/94)
- All synthesis done: cycles #73, #78, #84, #88, #92, #94, #95
- Experiment queue: 6 proposals, ALL execution-blocked (need Leo + real speech + venv)
- Backlog scan list: 2 low-ROI papers (MMA-Bench vision, "When Tone and Words Disagree" behavioral) — already assessed in cycle #79 as SCAN-only; doing them now at 12 AM = low signal/cost ratio

**Skip guard assessment:**
- Cycle #96 was 1 execution-blocked skip; this is the 2nd → guard says "force reflect (meta-audit)"
- BUT: meta-board is 10/10 SATURATED (all Qs answered). Forced meta-audit on saturated board = redundant noise. Guard intent = prevent complacency, not produce zero-value cycles.
- Decision: skip is correct. Redundant meta-audit would violate values.md #5 (cost-consciousness) and #1 (簡單).

**Cumulative state:**
- 96 cycles over 3 days, 16 deep reads, 19 gaps, 7 ideas, 3 experiment proposals, 2 paper pitches, 4 ARENA pre-digests
- Execution-blocked: ~26h (since cycle #82 priority-0 experiment design)

## Next: arXiv March 2 batch at ~14:00 Monday Taipei
## Secondary: Leo unblocks → Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18 phonological geometry)
