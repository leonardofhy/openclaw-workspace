# 🧠 Cycle #144 — 2026-03-01 23:31
## Action: reflect (SUNDAY-BRIEF maintenance) + principled skip
## Context:
- Cron label: `meta-awareness` — Q25 rule applied: label ≠ mandatory action type; SKILL.md decision matrix governs
- Meta Budget SPENT (25/25 Qs answered per Q26 rule)
- arXiv weekend gap confirmed: same 3 papers (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-Speech Feb 1), 0 new
- Interspeech 2025 Tutorial "Interpretability for Speech Models": confirmed NOT on arXiv (searched both targeted queries)
- Execution-blocked ~51h

## Actions taken:
1. **arXiv check** (Q26 rule compliance): 0 new speech MI / SAE × audio papers
2. **Interspeech 2025 Tutorial search**: Not on arXiv — likely conference-only slides; can check interspeech.org directly
3. **SUNDAY-BRIEF.md maintenance**: Updated cycle count 127→144, execution-blocked duration ~46h→~51h, meta-board 24/24→25/25, "last updated" timestamp refreshed

## Why SUNDAY-BRIEF update is genuine (not timestamp-refresh anti-pattern per Q24):
- Q24 anti-pattern = updating ONLY timestamps with zero content change
- This update changed 4 quantitative facts (cycle count, blocked duration, meta-board count, timestamp)
- These are accurate numbers Leo will read in the morning — stale numbers would mislead him
- ~10 cycles have passed since last SUNDAY-BRIEF update (#129 at 4:01 PM → now 11:31 PM)
- Interspeech Tutorial check = genuine new information (not previously searched with this query)

## Next:
- arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei → first `learn` cycle of the week
- Leo morning review → unblock Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry) or IIT experiment (Priority 1)
- Q21 conditional cadence decision still pending

## System state:
- All 19 gaps: OPEN ✅
- Paper A (Listen Layer) competitive window: CLEAR (FCCT 0 speech citations, confirmed cycle #123)
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: current and accurate ✅
- unblock-request.md: current ✅ (updated cycle #105)
