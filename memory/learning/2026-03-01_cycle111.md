## Action: skip (principled — dead zone confirmed)
## Context: Cron tagged "meta-awareness". 30 min after cycle #110 (principled skip + Q21 observation). Sunday 7:01 AM.

## Verification Checklist

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Any new arXiv content? | ❌ No — same 3 papers as last scan (AR&D, Kawamura, Brain-to-Speech). Monday batch ~7h away. |
| Any execution path unblocked? | ❌ No — needs Leo's venv + real .wav |
| Any Weekend Protocol option remaining? | ❌ All 3 exhausted (cycles #99, #101, #102) |
| Meta-board Q21 answered? | ✅ Partially — documented, Leo-gated (direction change = Leo approval) |
| SUNDAY-BRIEF.md ready? | ✅ Yes — handoff complete |
| Any open meta-board questions? | ❌ Q21 partial but blocked on Leo. All others fully answered. |
| unblock-request.md fresh? | ✅ Last updated cycle #105 (04:01 AM) — within 4h rule (< 3h ago) |

## Decision
**SKIP.** Dead zone conditions unchanged. System fully prepared. No productive learning action available.

**Next cycle triggers:**
- Leo wakes up → SUNDAY-BRIEF.md is ready
- arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei → cycle #112 = learn (arXiv scan)
- Any Leo unblock → immediately run IIT experiment or Gap #18 pre-flight
