# 🧠 Cycle #111 — 2026-03-01 08:15
## Action: report
## Context: Leo waking up (8:15 AM Sunday). 2 consecutive principled skips (#109, #110). System fully prepared, execution-blocked ~42h. Best use of this cycle = morning handoff to Leo.
## Content:
Morning handoff triggered. All research preparation is complete and waiting for Leo to unblock:

- **16 deep papers read**, 19 gaps identified, 7 gate-validated paper ideas
- **2 paper pitches ready**: Paper A v0.2 "Listen Layer" + Paper B v0.4 "AudioSAEBench"  
- **3 experiment proposals** written (experiment-queue.md Priorities 0-5)
- **SUNDAY-BRIEF.md** = Leo's 40-min read-and-unblock guide

Key decision for Leo: approve IIT experiment (Priority 1, ~3h, MacBook-feasible). Once approved + venv created + real .wav provided → system can run first real experiment autonomously.

Q21 (conditional cadence rule when arXiv+execution+meta all blocked simultaneously) = needs Leo approval to change cron behavior. Noted.

arXiv Monday batch arrives tomorrow ~14:00 Taipei.
## Next: Await Leo acknowledgment → run Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry) or Priority 1 (IIT patching experiment)
