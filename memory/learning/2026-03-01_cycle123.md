# 🧠 Cycle #123 — 2026-03-01 13:01
## Action: learn (citation scan + competitive intelligence)
## Context: Meta-burst pause expired at 13:01. All Weekend Protocol options exhausted (a=cycle#99, b=cycle#101, c=cycle#98). arXiv Monday batch ~25h away. Execution-blocked 45h. Ran competitive intelligence sweep as highest-value available action.
## Content:
**FCCT competitor scan** (arXiv:2511.05923, AAAI 2026 Oral — closest Paper A competitor):
- Citations checked via Semantic Scholar: 4 citing papers (MPR-GUI, MRRE, UrbanLN, CAMA)
- ALL 4 = vision/GUI/NLP domain
- **ZERO speech extensions of FCCT found**
- Competitor clock (Q12): still on track — speech extension expected Sept-Dec 2026 at earliest
- Leo's window: NeurIPS May 2026 deadline remains achievable IF experiments start in March 2026

**arXiv speech MI freshness check** (mech interp × speech):
- Top results still show: AR&D (Feb 24 = newest), Kawamura (Feb 16), Brain-to-speech (Feb 1), Behind the Scenes (Jan 22), ESNs (Jan 6), Beyond Transcription (Aug 2025)
- **0 new papers** since cycle #99 (midnight March 1)
- Gap confirmation: Leo's causal patching gap still FULLY OPEN
- Field still moving at ~2.5 papers/week pace — AR&D from Feb 24 was last entry

**Competitive summary:**
- Paper A ("Listen Layer"): 0 direct competitors. FCCT authors not yet extending to speech.
- Audio T-SAE (Idea #7): 0 audio temporal SAE papers (T-SAE camera-ready Feb 25, no extensions)
- All 19 gaps remain confirmed OPEN

## Next: Principled skip until arXiv Monday ~14:00 OR Leo unblocks (see SUNDAY-BRIEF.md)
