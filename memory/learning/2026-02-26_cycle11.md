# 🧠 Cycle #11 — 2026-02-26 19:00

## Action: reflect (+ micro-reflect)
## Context: Cycle #10 explicitly recommended reflect. Cycle #11 also triggers hygiene: >10 cycles = reflect due. AudioMatters deadline has passed (19:00) — Leo's attention now fully available for mech interp.

## Content

### State Assessment
- **10 cycles completed today** — exceptional productivity for Day 1
- 4 deep reads: UniWhisper, Beyond Transcription, AudioLens, AudioSAE
- 1 cheat sheet: TransformerLens + pyvene
- 1 working script: whisper_hook_demo.py (230 lines)
- 4 research gaps crystallized
- 3 paper ideas developed
- 0 experiments run (toolchain ready but not yet executed)

### What worked well
1. **Sequential deep reads built compound understanding** — Beyond Transcription → AudioLens → AudioSAE created a natural synthesis that none of them alone would have produced
2. **"Skip" at cycle #5 was correct** — respecting AudioMatters deadline per values.md cost-consciousness
3. **Skill-up before build** — learning the toolchain (cycle #9) before writing code (cycle #10) was correct order

### What to improve
1. **0 experiments run** — all reading, no execution. Day 2 must start with running `whisper_hook_demo.py`
2. **Code-read imbalance** — 4 papers : 0 experiments is too lopsided. Rule: every 4 learns → 1 build/run
3. **SPIRIT not read yet** — safety track paper still pending despite being on must-read list

### Key Synthesis (formalized)
**Triple Convergence Hypothesis**: Whisper layers 6-7 = universal "semantic crystallization zone":
- AudioSAE: audio→frame encoding transition at layers 6-7
- Beyond Transcription: saturation layer (encoder commits to transcription)
- AudioLens: critical layer (attribute resolves in LALM)
→ All three independently point to same region from different methods
→ Testable with existing `whisper_hook_demo.py` + logit-lens extension

**Crystallized research opportunity**: "Causal AudioLens" = AudioLens + patching → grounding_coefficient. This is Leo's clearest first paper opportunity with direct advisor (智凱哥) support.

### Micro-reflect: Cycle quality assessment
| Cycle | Value | Rating |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #1 UniWhisper | Context for AudioMatters | ⭐⭐ |
| #2 Competitive landscape | AudioMatters positioning | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| #3 Field scan | Revealed gap (only 4 papers!) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #4 Reflect | Planned well | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| #5 Skip | Correct decision | ✅ |
| #6 Beyond Transcription | Core method paper | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #7 AudioLens | Own lab's paper! | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #8 AudioSAE | Completed the synthesis | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #9 Skill-up | Enabled build cycle | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #10 Build | First concrete artifact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| #11 Reflect | Crystallized into action plan | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Average: strong day.** The 3 five-star cycles (6-7-8) created the synthesis that will drive the next month of work.

## Next
**Cycle #12 (next session):** `build` — extend whisper_hook_demo.py with logit-lens projection. Run "Triple Convergence" experiment. Concrete output: plot showing CKA + saturation curves on same axes.

**After that:**
1. Read SPIRIT (arXiv:2505.13541) — safety track anchor
2. Plan: write Causal AudioLens experiment design doc for 智凱哥 review
3. Deep Research results from Leo → integrate into goals.md
