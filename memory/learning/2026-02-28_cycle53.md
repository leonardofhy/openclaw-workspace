# 🧭 Cycle #53 — 2026-02-28 02:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — Q4 + Q5)
## Context: Meta-board had Q4 (report signal/noise) and Q5 (when to proactively request unblock) both unanswered. Pure writing task, no build required, reversible. After 3 reflect-heavy cycles (#50-52), this closes the meta-board's open items without drifting into new paper territory.

## Work Done

### Q4: Cycle Report Format

**Problem identified:** Verbose cycle reports bury the signal. When Leo reads cron summaries, he sees walls of text but needs to quickly know "what's new."

**Solution applied:** 3-line report format:
- ACTION: [type]
- NOVELTY: [one sentence — the single new thing]
- NEXT: [one sentence — what should happen next]

Rule: If cycle = skip, report = 2 lines max. Never repeat context already in goals/progress.

Written to `meta-awareness-board.md` Q4 section.

### Q5: Proactive Unblock Request Protocol

**Problem identified:** System was execution-blocked since cycle #42 (Feb 27 16:01) — ~12 cycles — without explicitly flagging this to Leo via a proper channel. The meta-board existed as an internal doc, but no external signal was sent.

**Solution applied:**
- Rule: after 3 consecutive execution-blocked skips → generate `memory/learning/unblock-request.md`
- File content: duration blocked, minimal unblock steps, 2 next experiments
- Main session (main chat with Leo) should check for this file and relay to Leo

**Created:** `memory/learning/unblock-request.md` ✅ (currently PENDING)

## Meta-Board Summary

All 6 questions now either answered (Q4, Q5) or have a filed proposal (Q1 = novelty classifier = build, needs Leo):
- Q1: Novelty classifier — still open (needs Leo approval for build)  
- Q2: Meta-audit task ranking → `experiment-queue.md` (cycle #51 ✅)
- Q3: Avoid re-scanning → arXiv scan cadence note added to SKILL.md (implicit in skip logic)
- Q4: Report format → 3-line format ✅ (this cycle)
- Q5: Unblock trigger → 3-skip rule + `unblock-request.md` ✅ (this cycle)
- Q6: Idea→execution queue → `experiment-queue.md` (cycle #51 ✅)

## Next: 
arXiv Feb 28 batch at ~14:00 Taipei. Until then: no high-value research action. But unblock-request.md exists if main session wants to relay to Leo.
