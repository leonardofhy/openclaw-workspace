# 🧠 Cycle #10 — 2026-02-26 18:30
## Action: build
## Context: 4 consecutive learn/skill-up cycles → time to build. AudioMatters deadline at 19:00 means Leo is unavailable; ideal window to generate a concrete artifact that will be ready post-deadline. Cheat sheet explicitly called out `whisper_hook_demo.py` as next step.

## Content

### Built: `skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py`

A ~230-line MacBook-feasible Whisper encoder activation explorer. Features:
- **Automatic dependency check** with clear install instructions
- **Synthetic audio fallback** (440+880 Hz sine wave) — no audio file needed to run
- **Full hook registration** on all N encoder layers via `register_forward_hook`
- **Layer stats table**: mean, std, Frobenius norm per layer — highlights layer 6-7 transition
- **Linear CKA heatmap** + norm-per-layer plot → saved to `/tmp/whisper_hook_demo.png`
- **Layer deep-inspect**: top-5 most active dimensions (candidates for probing/SAE)
- **Clean teardown**: hooks removed after forward pass

### Design decisions
- Used `openai-whisper` package (not HuggingFace) for simpler API (fewer dependencies for a demo)
- `matplotlib.use("Agg")` for headless safety; plot saved to file, not displayed
- `--no-plot` flag for minimal-dependency runs
- `--model tiny` for fastest first run; `--model base` for real experiments
- Commented every section with research connections (AudioSAE, Beyond Transcription)

### Usage
```bash
# First run (no audio, synthetic sine wave)
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py --no-plot

# With audio file
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py --audio my_speech.wav

# Install first if needed
pip install openai-whisper torch numpy matplotlib
```

### Research connection
- Layer 6-7 norm spike → will show in the Frobenius norm plot
- Top-5 active dimensions at layer 6 → candidate features for SAE
- CKA similarity drop between layers 5-7 → quantitative evidence of transition zone hypothesis
- This script is the "Experiment 2" from the cheat sheet (Whisper encoder cache + CKA)

## Next: 
- Post-AudioMatters (19:00): Leo runs the script → verifies toolchain works on MacBook
- Cycle #11: Either reflect (day wrap + update knowledge-graph.md) or learn (AudioSAE code deep-read)
- Consider: add SPIRIT paper to must-read now that AudioSAE steering mechanics are understood
