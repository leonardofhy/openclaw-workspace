# 🧠 Cycle #47 — 2026-02-27 23:01
## Action: learn (triage scan)
## Context: 11 PM — last arXiv scan of the day. Must-read list complete. Completing full Feb 27 cs.SD batch by checking 10 previously unscanned entries. Checking also for any last-hour cs.CL crosslists with mech interp angle.

## Content

### Feb 27 cs.SD Batch — Final Completion Pass
Scanned all 13 Feb 27 cs.SD entries. 10 not yet checked before this cycle:

| arXiv | Title (brief) | Verdict |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 2602.22431 | mmWave GAN speech reconstruction | SKIP — radar/HW |
| 2602.22417 | Absorbing discrete diffusion SE | SKIP — speech enhancement |
| 2602.22522 | Taiwanese Hakka ASR | SKIP — low-resource ASR |
| 2602.22487 | Moving speaker separation | SKIP — spatial audio |
| 2602.22266 | WaveSSM (wavelet SSMs) | SKIP — architecture |
| 2602.23070 | Bengali long-form ASR | SKIP — low-resource ASR |
| 2602.23068 | Text-Acoustic Dual Alignment (TTS) | SKIP — generation |
| 2602.22935 | Bangla ASR + diarization | SKIP — ASR |
| 2602.22710 | Modality Effects on Preference Alignment | SKIP — behavioral/PbRL |
| 2602.22597 | EEG neural reps of vocalized/imagined speech | SKIP — BCI/EEG |

**Previously scanned this day (cycles #39-40):** 2602.23333, 2602.23300, 2602.23136, 2602.17598, 2602.11488, 2602.22253

**Result: 0 new relevant papers from Feb 27 batch. Full batch exhausted.**

### State Assessment
- Feb 27 cs.SD: ✅ COMPLETE (13/13 checked)
- Feb 27 cs.CL (crosslists): previously checked in cycle #40 for mech interp × speech — still same top papers
- Semantic Scholar API: rate-limited (429)
- Backlog scan lists: both empty
- Must-read list: FULLY COMPLETE

## Gap Check
None of today's papers challenged or extended Leo's 16 identified gaps. Field is not producing new mech-interp-for-audio work today beyond what was already processed.

## Next
No more high-value actions available until:
1. Leo wakes up and approves IIT experiment (tomorrow morning)
2. Feb 28 arXiv batch appears (~14:00 Taipei tomorrow)

**This is the final cycle for Feb 27.** Research is execution-blocked, not idea-blocked.
