# 🧠 Cycle #103 — 2026-03-01 03:01
## Action: skip (principled — no high-value action available)
## Context: Meta-awareness cron trigger at 3:01 AM. Cycle #102 (2:31 AM, same session window) just completed a thorough meta-awareness audit: Q14 answered, DAS risk table written, paper-a-pitch.md Known Risks section appended. No new independent meta question can be answered without Leo input.

---

## Skip Justification

This is a **principled skip** (values.md #5 — cost-consciousness), NOT an execution-blocked skip:

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| arXiv batch available | ❌ Monday batch ~11h away (~14:00 Taipei) |
| Weekend Protocol options | ❌ All 3 exhausted (#99 citation trail, #101 DAS, #98 Gap#18 pre-flight) |
| Meta-board Q15 | ❌ Leo-gated (WER significance threshold = research design decision requiring Leo's judgment) |
| New paper available to read | ❌ No new high-value paper identified since #101 |
| Experiment execution | ❌ Blocked: real speech files, venv, GPU access all require Leo |
| Build action | ❌ Requires Leo approval per SKILL.md |
| Integration/consolidation | ✅ paper-a-pitch.md already updated in cycle #102 |

**Classification:** NOT execution-blocked (those require meta-audit after 2nd consecutive block). This is a legitimate "nothing to do" skip.

---

## Repeated-Skip Guard Check

- Last execution-blocked skip: None in recent cycles
- Cycle #96-#97: 2 consecutive skips → correctly triggered meta-awareness at #98 ✅
- Current streak: 0 execution-blocked skips (this is principled skip, not execution-blocked)
- No guard trigger needed.

## State Summary (carry-forward for next cycle)

**Completed this weekend (cycles #96-#103):**
- Q14: DAS assumption risk table for Paper A ✅
- Gap #18 experiment design doc (cycle #81-#82) ✅  
- paper-a-pitch.md Known Risks section ✅
- DAS foundational paper deep-read (cycle #101) ✅
- 100-cycle retrospective + Gap #20 Idea Gate (cycle #100) ✅
- Weekend Protocol rule established (cycle #98) ✅
- Weekend novelty ratio: 71% ✅ (target ≥65%)

**Next high-value action (Monday):**
1. **arXiv scan** — cs.SD + cs.CL + cs.AI Monday batch (~14:00 Taipei)
2. **If Leo wakes before arXiv:** Q15 (WER significance threshold for gc(L))
3. **If Leo activates venv:** Run Gap #18 Priority 0 experiment (phonological geometry check)

## Next: First Monday cycle should be learn (arXiv scan)
