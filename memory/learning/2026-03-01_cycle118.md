# 🧠 Cycle #118 — 2026-03-01 10:31
## Action: skip (principled — meta-burst pause active)
## Context: Meta-burst 4h pause active (started ~09:01, expires ~13:01). Another meta-reflect would violate anti-burst rule. arXiv Monday batch ~3.5h away (~14:00 Taipei). Execution-blocked 42h. Meta-board 22/22 SATURATED.
## Content:
State verified unchanged from cycle #117:
- arXiv: same 3 papers from last scan (no weekend batch)
- Execution-blocked: Priority 0 (Gap #18) still awaiting Leo
- Meta-board: 22/22 Qs SATURATED
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: current (updated cycle #117)
- unblock-request.md: current (updated cycle #105)
- Meta-burst pause: ACTIVE, expires ~13:01

No high-value action available within constraints. Skip is correct.

**Next high-value cycles:**
1. arXiv Monday scan ~14:00 Taipei (cs.SD + cs.CL new batch)
2. Leo wakes up → route to SUNDAY-BRIEF.md → unblock Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry)
## Next: arXiv Monday batch ~14:00 OR Leo unblock → Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18)
