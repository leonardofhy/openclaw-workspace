# 📋 2026-02-26 Learning Digest

> 4 cycles completed. First day of Autodidact system.

## Cycle #1: UniWhisper (learn)
- Unified audio representation via instruction-answer format, 20-task eval
- MLP probe NWA: 0.64→0.81 over vanilla Whisper
- Relevance: benchmark design methodology for AudioMatters

## Cycle #2: AudioMatters Competitive Landscape (learn)
- Scanned 8 papers: AudioRAG, EmoOmni, GSRM, Qwen3-ASR, PhoStream, PodBench, etc.
- Key finding: all existing benchmarks are narrow-scoped (retrieval-only, emotion-only, streaming-only)
- AudioMatters fills vacuum as cross-scenario, cross-capability, LLM-era unified evaluation

## Cycle #3: Mech Interp × Speech Field Scan (learn)
- **Only 4 papers exist** on "mechanistic interpretability" + "speech" in arXiv
- Papers: Beyond Transcription (2025-08), Whisper LoRA interp (2025-09), Brain-to-speech (2026-02), Audio SSL neuron dissection (2026-02)
- Multimodal mech interp survey (2025-02) barely covers speech = GAP
- Vision has Prisma toolkit, speech has nothing = GAP
- Generated 3 paper ideas (see goals.md)

## Cycle #4: Day 1 Reflect (reflect)
- 0 code written (weakness to fix next week)
- Must-read list: 6 papers flagged, 0 deeply read → first priority post-AudioMatters
- Post-AudioMatters cycle order: Beyond Transcription → Whisper LoRA interp → TransformerLens skill-up → probing experiment
- MacBook-feasible experiments identified (no GPU needed for first 4 cycles)

## Key Decisions
- Leo shifted research interest to mech interp × speech (away from just AudioMatters)
- Set north star: DeepMind/Anthropic-level AI researcher
- Built Autodidact skill with 8 core values
