# 🌅 Sunday Morning Brief — March 1, 2026

> Written by autodidact cycle #108 (5:31 AM). Last updated: cycle #144 (11:31 PM). For Leo to read when he wakes up.
> TL;DR: 144 cycles of research done. Execution-blocked ~51h. Everything is ready. You need ~20 minutes + one decision.

## Situation (3 sentences)

The autodidact system has been running for **5 days** (Feb 26 – Mar 1), completing **144 cycles** that produced: 16 deep paper reads, 19 research gaps identified, 7 paper ideas (all gate-validated), 2 complete paper pitches (A + B), 25 system improvements (meta-board 25/25 Qs), and 3 executable experiment proposals. Since Feb 27 (cycle #42), the system has been **execution-blocked** — every high-value next step requires a real speech .wav file, a Python venv, or Leo's approval. The block can be cleared in **20 minutes of Leo's time**, after which the system can run the first real experiment autonomously.

## 5-Step Unblock (copy-paste)

```bash
# Step 0: Priority 0 prerequisite (Gap #18, 2 min)
git clone https://github.com/juice500ml/phonetic-arithmetic /tmp/phonetic-arithmetic

# Step 1: Create venv (5 min)
python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env
source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate
pip install nnsight openai-whisper torch pyvene

# Step 2: Get real speech file (2 min — any option)
curl -L "https://github.com/librosa/librosa/raw/main/tests/data/libri1.wav" -o /tmp/test.wav
# OR: record yourself / drop any .wav in workspace/

# Step 3: Validate Triple Convergence with real speech (2 min)
cd /Users/leonardo/.openclaw/workspace
python skills/autodidact/scripts/whisper_hook_demo.py /tmp/test.wav
# Expected: CKA clusters [0-2] acoustic, [3-5] semantic; norm jump at layer 3

# Step 4: Approve IIT experiment — just say yes/no
# Full description in experiment-queue.md Priority 1 (3h autonomous, MacBook-feasible)
```

## 3 Decisions for Leo

1. **🔬 Approve IIT experiment?** (Priority 1 in experiment-queue.md) — macbook-feasible, ~3h, starts validating Listen Layer Hypothesis. If approved, autodidact runs it next cycle autonomously.

2. **📄 Paper A venue?** — Two options, both viable:
   - **NeurIPS 2026** (May deadline, ~2 months): flagship venue, competitive, needs experiments done by April
   - **Interspeech 2026** (PDF March 5): IMPOSSIBLE — 4 days away, experiments haven't started
   - → NeurIPS is the realistic first target. EMNLP 2026 is backup.

3. **💬 Contact 智凱哥 about AudioLens codebase?** — Short message: "我在做 Causal AudioLens 的延伸，你的 codebase 可以分享嗎？" 5 minutes. High strategic value.

## After Unblock: What Happens Automatically

Once Leo runs the 5 steps above and approves the IIT experiment:
- Cycle #109: Run Whisper-small IIT patching experiment (~3h, no GPU needed)
- Cycle #110: Analyze results, update Listen Layer Hypothesis confidence
- Cycle #111+: If hypothesis holds → design Qwen2-Audio experiment (needs NDIF/GPU)
- This week's goal: **first real experimental result** in 107 cycles of prep

## Also: Quick Admin Item

⚠️ **Delete dead cron job:** `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting` (disabled, past, error state) — ask Leo or run `openclaw cron list` and delete it.

---

## ⭐ Quick Decision (Q21 — 1 line, increasingly urgent)

> **Approve conditional cadence rule?** (2h intervals during dead zones: weekend arXiv gap + execution-blocked + meta-board saturated — all 3 simultaneously). Saves ~$0.25/dead-zone period. Resumes 30-min immediately when any condition lifts.
> **Why urgent:** Cycles #120–122 turned into "timestamp refreshes" (zero value, now classified as anti-pattern Q24). This would not have happened with conditional cadence. The rule is now validated by empirical evidence, not just cost analysis.
> Full cost analysis in: `memory/learning/2026-03-01_cycle112.md`

---

## System Health Note (cycle #127)

**Q25 resolved (cycle #125):** The cron label `ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness` was being misread as "every cycle must be meta-awareness." Corrected — SKILL.md decision matrix governs; meta-awareness is the fallback, not the mandate. The 3-skip → force-reflect guard already provides mandatory meta coverage. No SKILL.md changes needed.
