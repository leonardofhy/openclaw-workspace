# 🧠 Cycle #20 — 2026-02-27 00:34
## Action: learn (autodidact-forced)
## Context: Late-night forced cycle by user request. Goal: survey ONE new high-value direction beyond active audio mech-interp tracks.
## Tags: #CoT-faithfulness #representation-engineering #multimodal #perceptual-grounding #new-direction

## Direction Surveyed:
**Representation Engineering × CoT Faithfulness for Audio-Language Models**

核心問題：當 ALM 說「我聽到憤怒的語氣」，它的內部表示真的編碼了憤怒的聲學特徵，還是只是在補完文字模式？
