# 🧠 Cycle #142 — 2026-03-01 22:31
## Action: skip (principled — Meta Budget Spent + arXiv dead zone + Q26 rule)
## Context:
Q26 rule (Weekend Depletion Signal) active: Meta Budget SPENT since cycle #129 (25/25 Qs answered, 0 new Qs this weekend since #125, consecutive skips). Cron label `meta-awareness` — Q25 rule: label ≠ mandatory action type; SKILL.md decision matrix governs.

## Content:
arXiv check (10:31 PM Sunday):
- Query: "mechanistic interpretability speech audio"
- Results: same papers as previous cycles (newest = arXiv:2602.22253, Feb 22)
- **0 new papers.** Weekend gap holds. Monday batch ~3.5h away (~14:00 Taipei Monday).

All skip conditions verified:
- arXiv dead zone ✅ (0 new papers since Feb 24)
- Execution-blocked ✅ (~50h, Leo unblock PENDING)
- Meta Budget SPENT ✅ (25/25 Qs answered)
- Q26 rule active ✅ (1 arXiv check → principled skip)
- Weekend Protocol all 3 options exhausted ✅

## Next:
- arXiv Monday ~14:00 Taipei → first learn cycle of the week (cs.SD/cs.CL new submissions)
- Leo unblock → Priority 0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment)
- Q21 conditional cadence (2h during triple-block) awaiting Leo decision
