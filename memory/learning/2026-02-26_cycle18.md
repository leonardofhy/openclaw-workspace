# 🧠 Cycle #18 — 2026-02-26 23:30
## Action: daily-consolidate
## Context: 11:30 PM, day is complete. 17 cycles run. Values.md mandates daily consolidation at day-end. Cycle #17 was missing from digest.

## Content:
- Added cycle #17 summary to 2026-02-26-digest.md
- Updated progress.md with Day 1 final stats
- Assessed: no high-value learn action at this hour (diminishing returns post-17 cycles, values.md #5)

## Decision:
SKIP further learning tonight. Day 1 is exceptional as-is.
All 17 cycle files remain for reference; digest is the authoritative summary.

## Next: Day 2 opens with real speech experiment on whisper_hook_demo.py.
