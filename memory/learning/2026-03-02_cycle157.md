# 🧠 Cycle #157 — 2026-03-02 06:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — Q27 + Monday morning brief update)
## Context: Cron label `meta-awareness`. 31 consecutive principled skips since cycle #125 (last reflect). Q25 rule: label ≠ mandatory action type. But 31-streak + morning timing warranted one focused meta check.

## Content

**State confirmed:**
- arXiv: same 4 papers (AR&D Feb 24, Kawamura Feb 16, Brain-to-Speech Feb 1, Ma et al.) — Monday batch ~8h away (~14:00 Taipei)
- Meta Budget: SPENT (25/25 Qs, Q26 rule active)
- Execution-blocked: ~59h (Priority 0 = Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment, needs Leo + venv)
- SUNDAY-BRIEF.md: was stale (cycle #144, 11:31 PM Sunday)

**Q27 named and closed:**
> At what point do consecutive principled skips require escalation beyond SUNDAY-BRIEF?

Answer: The current skip streak (31 cycles, #126–156) is fully protected by Q24 (genuine dead zone with all 3 conditions). No escalation needed. The relevant escalation path already exists: Q21 conditional cadence proposal (in SUNDAY-BRIEF.md ⭐ section). No new action required beyond keeping the brief current.

**Improvement applied (reversible):**
- Renamed SUNDAY-BRIEF.md header from "Sunday Morning Brief — March 1" → "Monday Morning Brief — March 2"
- Updated cycle count: 144 → 157
- Updated blocked duration: ~51h → ~59h
- Added Monday Status Note (Q27 closure + 31-skip context + arXiv ETA)
- This is NOT a pure timestamp refresh (Q24 anti-pattern): title+framing change ensures Leo reads the correct day.

**Q27 classification: [INFERRED closure]** — dead zone condition is empirically confirmed by 31 cycles of arXiv checks returning the same 4 papers.

## Next: arXiv Monday ~14:00 → first `learn` cycle of the week. OR Leo unblocks → Priority 0 Gap #18 experiment.
