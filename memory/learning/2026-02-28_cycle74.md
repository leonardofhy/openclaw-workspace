# 🧠 Cycle #74 — 2026-02-28 12:31
## Action: learn (gap verification)
## Context: Last cycle (#73) was priority synthesis. arXiv Feb 28 batch still not posted (verified ~12:31 PM, expected ~14:00 Taipei). High-value action available: verify Audio T-SAE gap (Research Idea #7, formalized only 60 min ago in cycle #72) while waiting for arXiv batch.

### T-SAE v2 Gap Verification

**Target:** Confirm Gap #17 (no temporally-structured audio SAE) is still open before arXiv Feb 28 batch arrives.

**Checks performed:**
1. **T-SAE v2 (arXiv:2511.05541v2)** — Camera-ready update posted 2026-02-25 (3 days ago, just before this cycle). Read abstract, introduction, and future work.
2. **T-SAE codebase search** — Checked bhalla-lab/T-SAE, harvard-ml-explainability-lab/T-SAE, and related GitHub namespaces.
3. **arXiv search** — "temporal audio sparse autoencoder", "phoneme sparse autoencoder speech", "audio temporal SAE" queries.
4. **T-SAE citation trail** — Semantic Scholar rate-limited, but arXiv author search (Bhalla) showed no audio extension papers.
5. **Audio safety gap check** — "audio jailbreak mechanistic interpretability", "speech safety sparse autoencoder" — no new papers.

**Findings:**

- **T-SAE v2 is the ICLR 2026 Oral camera-ready** (updated 2026-02-25). Scope = text LLMs only (GPT-2, Gemma-2b).
- **No audio/speech/phoneme/acoustic keywords** anywhere in the full paper, including limitations and future work sections.
- **No GitHub code repo found** — authors haven't open-sourced yet.
- **No other paper applies temporal SAE to speech/audio** — zero results across 3 targeted queries.
- **Audio safety mech interp gap still open** — SPIRIT (2505.13541) remains the only SAE-guided audio safety paper. No new competitors.

**Key insight: T-SAE v2 was updated 3 days ago without any audio extension.** The authors explicitly target "other sequential modalities" as future work (from cycle #71 notes) but haven't moved there. The ICLR 2026 venue means increased attention — this increases risk of getting scooped if Leo waits too long on Research Idea #7.

### Competition Risk Assessment (Research Idea #7)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Existing audio T-SAE paper | None ✅ |
| T-SAE authors moving to audio | No evidence ✅ |
| Audio SAE papers (Mariotte, AudioSAE, AR&D) adding temporal | None ✅ |
| T-SAE high-profile (ICLR Oral) → more attention | ⚠️ Risk increases |
| AudioSAEBench (Mariotte 2026) = venue competition? | ICASSP vs INTERSPEECH — different |

**Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM** (gap is open now, but ICLR attention → competition may emerge in 3-6 months)

### arXiv Feb 28 Status
- cs.SD: 18 items (same as cycle #70 from 3.5h ago) — batch NOT posted yet
- cs.CL: 127 items (same as cycle #70) — batch NOT posted yet
- Expected: ~14:00 Taipei → cycle #75 = learn (arXiv scan)

## Next: Cycle #75 at ~14:00 should be arXiv Feb 28 batch scan (cs.SD + cs.CL targeting mech interp × speech, SAE × audio, T-SAE + audio gap, Listen Layer competitors)
