# 🧭 Cycle #52 — 2026-02-28 01:31
## Action: reflect (meta-system — cron audit)
## Context: Meta-awareness board item #3 pending: "Run one weekly cron audit: keep / edit / disable jobs by value." Execution-blocked since cycle #41 (arXiv + Leo unblock needed). Cycles #50-51 applied SKILL guard + experiment-queue. This cycle completes the meta-board backlog.

### ⚠️ Category B — Needs Attention

| Job | Issue | Recommendation |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| **週報 + weekly-research-summary** | Both run 週日 21:00; weekly-research-summary has NO delivery channel explicitly set (uses announce→discord but channel not set) | Check if they overlap / duplicate; weekly-research-summary should deliver to Leo's channel. **Minor: confirm channel.** |
| **ai-learning-30min-meta-awareness** (THIS JOB) | Running 24/7 every 30min; most cycles are skip when Leo is active (daylight). Token cost significant. | **Proposed optimization:** After arXiv batch (14:00 Taipei), most value is extracted. Consider reducing to every 60min between 02:00-14:00 when no new arXiv expected. **BUT:** Leo explicitly said continue 30-min cadence. Keep as-is per Leo's instruction. |
| **ai-safety-radar-30min** | Runs 9:15-23:45, every 30 min; generates ai-safety-radar.md; 2 digest jobs read it. Signal quality unknown. | Monitor: is it producing actionable content? First week data incomplete. Keep for now, reassess after 1 week. |
| **merge-to-main** | Runs 14:00 and 02:00 daily; very new job (2026-02-28 creation). No lastStatus yet. | Monitor: confirm it runs cleanly without conflicts. Low risk. |
| **提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting** | **Disabled, last error = "fetch failed", deleteAfterRun=true but still exists.** | DEAD JOB — should be cleaned up. Note for Leo: can be deleted (it's in the past, 2026-02-26 deadline). |

### ❌ Category C — Stale / Dead

| Job | Status | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting | disabled, past deadline (Feb 26 meeting), error state | **Flag for deletion by Leo** (requires Leo action — do not delete cron jobs without approval per values.md) |

## Overlap Analysis

**Sunday 21:00 congestion:**
- 週報 (週日 21:00)
- 週排程生成 (週日 21:00)
- weekly-research-summary (週日 21:00)
- NTUAIS 週日 lead reset (週日 21:20)

Four jobs within 20 minutes on Sunday evenings. All isolated sessions so no conflict, but combined token cost is high. Not a problem unless cost becomes an issue.

---

## Skip Loop Analysis (autodidact-specific)

Looking at Day 2 skip ratio:
- Cycles #20-48: ~16 skips out of 29 cycles = 55% skip rate
- Most skips correctly execution-blocked (queue depleted, arXiv not yet posted)
- 5 consecutive skips (#41-45) triggered meta-audit → cycles #50-51 produced real artifacts
- **Skip guard working correctly** ✅

**Proposed cadence improvement (reversible):**
Between 00:00-13:00 Taipei when arXiv has no new batch AND must-read list is complete AND execution-blocked:
- Still run cycle, but action should be `reflect` or `meta-audit` on existing knowledge rather than skip
- This maximizes value from overnight cycles instead of burning tokens on no-ops
- Already partially handled by skip guard; this makes it more proactive

## Applied Improvement (this cycle)

Updating meta-awareness-board.md to mark item #3 complete and record cron audit findings.

## Next: 
- Flag dead job for Leo (SL Weekly Meeting cron cleanup)
- arXiv Feb 28 batch at ~14:00 Taipei is next high-value action
- Cycle #53 should be `skip` (arXiv not yet posted) unless another meta task surfaces
