# 🧠 Cycle #57 — 2026-02-28 04:01

## Action: plan
## Context: 4 AM; arXiv Feb 28 batch unavailable until ~14:00; meta-board fully answered (6/6); last reflect was cycle #56 at 3:31 AM (only 30 min ago). Paper A's ideas are crystallized across knowledge-graph but no single reviewable pitch document exists for Leo. High-value output achievable without Leo or GPU.

## Content

**Created `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md`** — Paper A pitch for "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs"

Key contents:
- **1-sentence pitch**: causal localization of audio-consultation layer in speech LLMs
- **Abstract draft** (150-word target) — first full draft
- **Why this paper wins**: 5-row comparison table vs AudioLens/ALME/Modality Collapse/Cascade Equivalence
- **3-phase method**: E1 (Whisper-small, MacBook, ~3h) → E2 (Qwen2-Audio-7B, NDIF) → E3+E4 (extensions)
- **Experiments table**: 4 experiments, resource + time + output specified
- **Related work map**: 7 papers, each with explicit relationship to this paper
- **Venue comparison table**: Interspeech 2026 vs NeurIPS 2026 vs EMNLP 2026
- **Leo's next steps**: 4 concrete actions to start today (first one = 5 min)
- **4 open questions for Leo**: scope, ALME attribution, co-authorship, venue

## Next: Leo reviews paper-a-pitch.md → makes 4 decisions → E1 starts (~3h MacBook)
