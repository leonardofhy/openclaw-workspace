# 🧠 Cycle #5 — 2026-02-26 16:00
## Action: skip
## Context: AudioMatters CMT deadline in ~3h (today 19:00). Cycle #4 explicitly flagged skip for any same-day trigger. No high-value action available that doesn't conflict with deadline focus.

---

## ORIENT Summary
- Last action: reflect (Cycle #4, 15:05)
- Recommended next: deep-read "Beyond Transcription" (Glazer 2025-08)
- Current constraint: AudioMatters crunch mode — Leo needs CPU for CMT, not for research reading

## DECIDE Rationale
Checked all action types:
- **learn**: Valid target (Beyond Transcription), but today's context says skip until post-AudioMatters
- **plan**: Goals.md was just updated 90 min ago by Leo directly — no planning needed
- **build**: No GPU-free build task ready; would require setup
- **reflect**: Already done this cycle
- **skill-up**: Would require focused attention Leo doesn't have right now

**Decision: skip.** Consistent with values.md principle #5 (成本意識 — low-value cycles直接跳過) and Cycle #4's explicit instruction.

## Pre-staging for Cycle #6 (post-AudioMatters)
Next cycle should start with:
1. Fetch arXiv:2508.15882 ("Beyond Transcription" by Glazer et al.)
2. Read abstract + Methods + Results deeply
3. Note: which activation patching technique? Which ASR model? How do they measure causal contribution?

## Next: Cycle #6 (post-2026-03-05)
Deep-read "Beyond Transcription" — the foundational mech interp × ASR paper.
