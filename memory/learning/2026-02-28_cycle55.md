# 🧠 Cycle #55 — 2026-02-28 03:01
## Action: reflect (meta-synthesis)
## Context: Cycle #54 produced AudioSAEBench v0.1 draft (excellent work) but didn't update knowledge-graph. The KG's paper opportunity section (H) and SAEBench section (J) are stale. Also: cycles #50-54 produced 5 meta-artifacts but no integration pass was done to see if they cohere. This cycle: synthesize + integrate.

## Content: 2-Paper Portfolio Synthesis

### Core observation
The "Grounding Sensitivity" metric is the *linking pin* between AudioSAEBench (Track 2) and "Listen Layer" (Track 3):

```
Track 2 (AudioSAEBench):
  → Grounding Sensitivity = for each SAE FEATURE, what fraction of its activation comes from audio?
  → gc per feature → "grounding histogram" across all features in a model

Track 3 (Listen Layer / Causal AudioLens):
  → Grounding Sensitivity = for each LAYER, what fraction of the model's decision comes from audio?
  → gc per layer → "listen layer" = layer with highest audio causal contribution
```

These are the **same metric applied at different granularities**:
- Feature-level gc → AudioSAEBench (Track 2, benchmark contribution)
- Layer-level gc → "Localizing the Listen Layer" (Track 3, paper contribution)

**Implication**: One unified framework ("Grounding Sensitivity") can ground BOTH papers. Track 3 runs the macro experiment; Track 2 runs the micro experiment. Same stimuli (ALME conflict pairs), same patching protocol, same theoretical foundation (Causal Abstraction / IIT).

### Unified thesis connection
Both papers test the same underlying question — "How much does an audio-LLM actually rely on audio?" — at different levels of abstraction. The thesis north star is:

> "Mechanistic units (features/circuits) → reliable error localization + controllable intervention"

- Track 3 (Listen Layer): localize WHERE in the model audio is consulted (layer-level)
- Track 2 (AudioSAEBench): localize WHICH features are audio-grounded vs text-predicted (feature-level)
- Both = "reliable error localization" ✅
- Steering (AudioSAEBench Category 4: Causal Controllability): "controllable intervention" ✅

### 2-Paper portfolio order (recommended to Leo)
1. **Paper A (Track 3)**: "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs" — smaller scope, faster to execute (3h experiment on MacBook), sharper claim, lower barrier. This is the "first result" that establishes the method.
2. **Paper B (Track 2)**: "AudioSAEBench: Multi-Metric Evaluation of SAEs for Speech and Audio LMs" — larger scope, needs multiple SAE baselines + ALME stimuli + GPU for Qwen2-Audio. This is the "community resource" paper that builds on Paper A's methodology.

**Why this order matters**: Paper A's grounding_coefficient method IS Paper B's Category 5 (Grounding Sensitivity). Paper A validates the method at layer granularity; Paper B scales it to feature granularity. Leo should do Paper A first — then Paper B's most novel contribution (Grounding Sensitivity) already has a validated predecessor.

### Meta-system findings (this session, cycles #50-54)
What meta-work was done and did it actually improve the system?

| Cycle | Meta-artifact | Concrete improvement? |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| #50 | Skip guard added to SKILL.md | ✅ Yes — prevents future 10+ skip chains |
| #51 | experiment-queue.md created | ✅ Yes — Leo has clear unblock checklist |
| #52 | Cron audit | ✅ Yes — dead SL meeting job flagged for deletion |
| #53 | 3-line report format + unblock protocol | ✅ Yes — reduced future noise |
| #54 | AudioSAEBench design draft | ✅ Yes — Track 2 now has concrete protocol |

**Assessment**: All 5 meta cycles were genuinely high-value. None were redundant. The system is now better than it was at cycle #49.

### Open question (for future meta-awareness board)
Q7: "When does stopping learning and synthesizing produce more value than continuing to read?" 
Current answer (empirical, this session): after ~12 deep reads in 2 days, synthesis quality surpasses marginal paper gain. The meta-synthesis cycles (#50-54 + #55) are producing clear compound insights that individual paper reads were not.

**Rule candidate**: After N=12 deep reads without running any experiments, insert a synthesis cycle before the next paper.

## Knowledge-graph update (to apply in this cycle)
1. Update section H: AudioSAEBench entry → expand with v0.1 protocol summary + 2-paper order
2. Update section J: Add connection to "Listen Layer" = same metric at different granularity
3. Add Synthesis Insight: "Grounding Sensitivity Unification" to cross-paper connections

---

## Next:
- **KG updated in this cycle** (see below)
- **For Leo (morning)**: present 2-paper portfolio synthesis — Paper A then Paper B order
- **Next cycle action**: learn — wait for arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 Taipei); if cycle before then, skip is correct
- Unblock-request.md remains PENDING (sent to Leo in morning main session)
