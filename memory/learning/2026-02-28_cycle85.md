# 🧠 Cycle #85 — 2026-02-28 18:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness + radar synthesis)
## Context: Saturday evening. arXiv Feb 28 = no weekend batch. Daily-consolidate just done (cycle #84, 30 min ago). Q7 synthesis threshold active (saturation). Meta-board 6/6 answered. Cron label = meta-awareness. Picked the highest-value action: surfacing two AI safety radar items directly relevant to Leo's skill gaps + research.

### AI Safety Radar → Research Portfolio Connections

**1. ARENA: 8 New Exercise Sets (karma: 65, CallumMcDougall, Feb 27)**
- URL: https://learn.arena.education/ (branch: `alignment-science`, merging to main Sunday Feb 29)
- **New exercise sets directly relevant to Leo's skill gaps:**
  - **Linear Probes** — replication of "Geometry of Truth" + Apollo's "Probing for Deception"
  - **Activation Oracles** — model diffing exercises
  - **Attribution Graphs** — build from scratch + `circuit-tracer` library
  - **Emergent Misalignment** — Soligo & Turner's work; model organisms, LoRA finetunes, autoraters
  - **Science of Misalignment** — case studies (Palisade work, etc.)
- **Why this matters for Leo:**
  - Linear Probes → directly teaches the probing methodology needed for Paper B (AudioSAEBench metric validation)
  - Attribution Graphs → `circuit-tracer` is *exactly* what Leo needs for Track 1 (Audio IOI / circuit graph), and covers patching in a hands-on curriculum
  - Emergent Misalignment → LoRA exercise set covers "what does fine-tuning change mechanistically" = Track 4's core question
  - **Skill gap addressed:** Causal abstraction / TransformerLens / circuit analysis — all in SKILL.md gap list
- **Action for Leo:** Do the "Linear Probes" + "Attribution Graphs" ARENA exercises before writing pyvene/NNsight code. Estimated: 2-4 days. Dramatically reduces risk of wasted experimental effort.
- **URL:** https://learn.arena.education/ (filter by chapter: `alignment-science`)

**2. "Why Did My Model Do That? Model Incrimination" (Neel Nanda et al., MATS 9.0, AF)**
- URL: https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Bv4CLkNzuG6XYTjEe/why-did-my-model-do-that-model-incrimination-for-diagnosing
- Framework for forensically diagnosing LLM misbehavior: CoT reading + counterfactual prompting + convergent black-box evidence
- **Why this matters for Leo:**
  - "Model Incrimination" = causal attribution of behavior to components → same methodology as Track 3 grounding_coefficient
  - Their 3-method framework (CoT reading + counterfactual prompting + convergent evidence) = blueprint for Paper A's experimental validation section
  - Connect to SPIRIT: SPIRIT does activation patching for defense; "Model Incrimination" does causal attribution for diagnosis → combined = **mechanistic safety pipeline** for Track 5

### Meta-Awareness System Check

**Execution-blocked duration:** 35+ hours (since cycle #42, Feb 27 16:01)
- unblock-request.md status: PENDING (since cycle #53, Feb 28 02:01)
- Q5 rule: relay to Leo if blocked > 3 consecutive skips → DONE (relay in cycle #62 + #67)
- **Assessment: system working correctly**. Execution-blocked is an external blocker (Leo approval + real speech + venv), not a system failure. Meta-awareness cycles have been productive.

**New meta-observation:** ARENA material represents a **pre-experiment skill-up path** that would make experiments HIGHER quality. Leo doing the ARENA attribution-graph exercises BEFORE the IIT experiment = better code, cleaner methodology, fewer wasted iterations. This is the kind of "meta" recommendation that saves time downstream.

**System health:** ✅ All guards active. Q7 threshold rule enforced (no more synthesis today). Skip ratio improving. Meta-board saturated (good).

### Radar Summary (Feb 28 — Saturday)
- No new arXiv (weekend)
- Top LW/AF picks today: ARENA curriculum (actionable!), Schelling Goodness (alignment theory), AI #157 Zvi weekly synthesis, Anthropic/DoD coverage, RSP version comparison
- Most directly actionable: **ARENA** — Leo can start this during off-compute downtime

## Next
- **Next cycle (#86):** skip or brief radar check (18:31 PM — Saturday evening, nothing new)
- **Monday (~14:00 Taipei):** arXiv Feb 28/Mar 1 batch scan = back to `learn` mode
- **Leo action queue** (priority 0): see experiment-queue.md. Adding ARENA suggestion as pre-experiment skill-up recommendation.
