# 🧠 Cycle #41 — 2026-02-27 15:01
## Action: reflect
## Context: 4 consecutive learn cycles (#37-40) → forced reflect per SKILL.md rules. Cycle #40 (14:01) was the Feb 27 arXiv batch scan — high-value synthesis. Now 1 hour later with no new arXiv papers and queue in good shape.

## Content: Day 2 Afternoon Reflect

### Trigger
SKILL.md rule: "If last 3 cycles were all learn → force reflect." Cycles #37 (learn), #38 (learn), #39 (learn), #40 (learn) = 4 consecutive learns. Reflect triggered.

### What happened since last reflect (#36, 09:04)?

| Cycle | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| #37 | learn | AR&D (arXiv:2602.22253) — SAE framework for AudioLLMs; no audio-vs-text test = Track 3 gap |
| #38 | learn | SAEBench (arXiv:2503.09532) — 8-metric template for AudioSAEBench; "Grounding Sensitivity" = novel metric idea |
| #39 | learn | MiSTER-E (2602.23300) scan; Feb 27 arXiv not yet live |
| #40 | learn | **MAJOR**: Feb 27 arXiv batch — 3 direct Track 3 papers (Modality Collapse, Cascade Equivalence, ALME); "Listen Layer Hypothesis" synthesized |

### Listen Layer Hypothesis — Crystallized (Cycle #40 synthesis)
A new hypothesis emerges from converging 5 papers:
- **Claim:** There exists a small set of LLM attention heads at specific layers ("the listen layer") where audio representations are *causally* consulted — not just linearly present
- **Evidence:** Behavioral localization from 5 independent papers all point to text dominance occurring at the LLM level (not encoder)
- **Leo's unique contribution:** Layer-wise denoising patching sweep = *the* method that localizes this causally, at layer granularity, which NONE of the 5 papers have done
- **Paper title candidate:** "Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs"
- **Field urgency:** ~2 papers/week in this space (Feb 2026); window is open but closing

### State Assessment

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Must-read list | ✅ COMPLETE (all 10 papers done) |
| Field mapping | ✅ 21+ papers scanned, 13 deep reads |
| Experiment proposals | ✅ 2 ready (IIT Triple Convergence + Class-specific Neuron Grounding) |
| Paper ideas | ✅ 6 crystallized (knowledge-graph section H) |
| Research gaps | ✅ 16 identified and documented |
| Code | ✅ 2 scripts verified (whisper_hook_demo.py, whisper_logit_lens.py) |
| Cheat sheets | ✅ 1 (TransformerLens+pyvene+NNsight) |
| arXiv radar | ✅ Current (Feb 27 batch just scanned) |
| **Bottleneck** | 🟡 Leo approval + real speech file + venv setup |

### What Is the Bottleneck?
All reading, synthesis, planning done. The research is now **execution-blocked** — not idea-blocked.

Three actions needed from Leo (unchanged from cycle #36):
1. **Approve IIT experiment** (Experiment 1 in knowledge-graph — MacBook-feasible, NNsight, ~3h)
2. **Real speech .wav file** → run whisper_hook_demo.py on real audio (validates Triple Convergence with non-synthetic input)
3. **Create venv:** `python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env && source ~/audio-mi-env/bin/activate && pip install nnsight openai-whisper`

### Field Velocity Check (since Feb 2026)
- Modality Collapse (2602.23136) — Feb 26
- Cascade Equivalence (2602.17598) — Feb 19
- ALME (2602.11488) — Feb 12 (v2 Feb 19)
- AR&D (2602.22253) — Feb 24
- Kawamura AAPE (2602.15307) — Feb 12
- Zhao ESNs (2601.03115) — Jan 2026

**~2 papers/week on audio mech interp × grounding.** The "no causal patching, no layer-wise localization" gap is *still present* in all of them. This creates urgency but also validates the contribution.

### Trajectory Assessment
- Day 1 (Feb 26): 18 cycles, foundational reading, toolchain built
- Day 2 (Feb 27): 23 cycles so far, field expanded, Listen Layer Hypothesis crystallized
- Quality of ideas: getting better (Listen Layer > Triple Convergence > Causal AudioLens in specificity)
- Risk: over-accumulating ideas without executing experiments → need Leo to unblock

### Next Cycle Recommendation
- **Skip** if <30 min (arXiv won't update, Leo not yet back)
- **report** when Leo is active (present Listen Layer Hypothesis + updated action queue)
- **learn** if a new relevant paper appears in cs.SD/cs.CL before morning

## Next: Present Listen Layer Hypothesis to Leo when active. Skip until then unless new arXiv papers appear.
