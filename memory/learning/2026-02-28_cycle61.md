# 🧠 Cycle #61 — 2026-02-28 06:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Meta-awareness cron trigger. arXiv Feb 28 batch ~8h away. All reading complete. Execution-blocked since cycle #42. All 6 meta-board questions answered. Unblock-request PENDING since 02:01.

## Content

### State Check
- Execution-blocked: ~14h (cycles #42→#61, ~8h of real skip + 6h of meta-audit cycles)
- `unblock-request.md` generated at 02:01 — status still PENDING (Leo hasn't seen it this session yet)
- Meta-board: 6/6 questions answered + Q7 (synthesis threshold rule)
- Paper pitches: A + B both written (cycles #57-58)
- Experiment queue: 6 experiments, 0 executed, P3 unblocked with just a .wav file

### Meta-System Observations (new this cycle)

**Observation 1 — Unblock lag:**
The `blocked_to_action_time` target is <2h (per Week 10 target). The unblock-request was generated at 02:01 AM — 4 hours ago. This is exactly the gap the system should close. The cron-based delivery (main session as relay) is working; this cycle's summary IS the relay.

**Observation 2 — meta-awareness cycles trending to diminishing returns:**
Cycles #50-61 have been meta or skip cycles. The system has been thoroughly audited. Further meta-cycles without new inputs (arXiv, Leo feedback, real speech) will produce minimal novelty. The correct response: **hold on meta-audit until next trigger** (new inputs arrive or KPI deviation detected).

**Observation 3 — Q7 synthesis threshold in practice:**
14 deep reads without any experiment executed. Q7 rule triggers at 10 reads. This has now been synthesized twice (cycles #41, #55). System is correctly diagnosed: **synthesis saturation reached, only experiments or new data can add novelty now**.

### One Reversible Improvement Applied

**Added: "daily morning flag" note to meta-awareness-board.md** (see below)
- If `unblock-request.md` exists AND status=PENDING AND current_time is in 06:00-09:00 window → this cycle's summary should front-load the unblock request
- This makes the morning cron cadence useful even when execution-blocked: it becomes the messenger

### Assessment
- This cycle: genuine value (confirmed unblock-request status, identified diminishing meta returns, reinforced morning-as-messenger role)
- No new gaps or paper ideas (correctly: saturation reached)
- System improvement: foregrounding unblock request in morning summary

## Next: 
- Await arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 Taipei) — cycle #62 should be `learn` (arXiv scan)
- If Leo unblocks (speech file + venv): P3 real speech test first (5 min), then P1 IIT experiment (~3h)
- Hold further meta-audit cycles until new inputs arrive
