# 🧠 Cycle #62 — 2026-02-28 06:31
## Action: report (morning relay)
## Context: Meta-awareness saturation + morning window + unblock-request.md PENDING. All 7 meta-board questions answered. Morning relay rule (cycle #61) explicitly triggers this. Leo likely waking up — highest-value action = surface unblock request.

### Morning Status Report

**Research state:** Execution-blocked since cycle #42 (~16:01 Feb 27), ~14.5h. unblock-request.md PENDING since 02:01 AM.

**Why blocked:** Next experiments require Leo's 15-minute setup:
1. `python3 -m venv ~/audio-mi-env && pip install nnsight openai-whisper` (5 min)
2. Any real speech .wav file (record 5s, or drop any .wav in workspace/) (2 min)
3. Approve IIT experiment P1 (yes/no on experiment-queue.md) (5 min)

**What's ready to run the moment Leo unblocks:**
- P3 (Real speech test): 5 min, validates Triple Convergence Hypothesis with real audio
- P1 (IIT Triple Convergence): ~3h MacBook, finds causal "Listen Layer" in Whisper
- P2 (Listen Layer Paper): needs GPU/NDIF; foundation for Paper A ("Localizing the Listen Layer in Speech LLMs")

**Overnight meta-work (cycles #50-61) summary:**
- 6 system improvements applied (skip guard, unblock protocol, 3-line report format, cron audit, AudioSAEBench v0.1 design, 2-paper portfolio synthesis)
- Paper A + Paper B pitches written: `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md`, `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md`
- Week 9 KPI baseline: skip_ratio=48%, novelty_ratio=63%, blocked_to_action_time=30h→target <2h
- Meta-board Q1-Q7 all answered

**System health:**
- ⚠️ Dead cron job: `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting` — flag for deletion (disabled, past, error state)
- ✅ Everything else: 25/27 cron jobs healthy

**Next cron cycle:** Waiting for arXiv Feb 28 batch (~14:00 Taipei). Will run learn cycle then.

## Next: Await Leo unblock → P3 (real speech test, 5 min) → P1 (IIT experiment, ~3h)
