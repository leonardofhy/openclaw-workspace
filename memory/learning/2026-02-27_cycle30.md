### arXiv cs.SD — Feb 26, 2026 new submissions (5 papers)

| Paper | Relevance | Verdict |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 2602.22029 — MIDI-Informed Singing Accompaniment | Music generation | ❌ Skip |
| 2602.21741 — Bengali Long-Form ASR/Diarization | Whisper fine-tune, Bengali | ❌ Skip |
| 2602.21772 — UniWhisper (multi-task) | Already scanned Cycle #1 | ❌ Skip |
| 2602.22039 — Taiwanese Hokkien TG-ASR | Low-resource ASR | ❌ Skip |
| **2602.21900 — EmoOmni (ICML 2026)** | Omni-LLM emotion, Thinker-Talker | ⚠️ Scan |

### EmoOmni (Zhao et al., ICML 2026) — Scan
- **Problem**: Omni-LLMs fail at emotional dialogue; Thinker-Talker architecture uses hidden states to bridge thinker (LLM) and talker (speech synthesis) → emotional detail is lossy in transit
- **Solution**: E-CoT (emotional Chain-of-Thought) — make the model reason through emotion explicitly before generating; use E-CoT text as high-level instruction to the talker
- **Results**: EmoOmni-7B ≈ Qwen3Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking with same talker
- **Benchmark**: EmoOmniEval + EmoOmniPipe (data pipeline)

### MI Relevance Assessment

**This is a capability paper, not interpretability.** But it contains a key observation:

> "Thinker-Talker architectures are implicitly connected through hidden states, leading to the **loss of emotional details**."

This is a *behavioral diagnosis* without a mechanistic explanation. EmoOmni engineers around it (E-CoT); Leo can investigate *why* emotion is lossy:
- Which layers/components drop emotional information?
- Does audio emotion survive the connector bottleneck into the LLM?
- Is the loss acoustic (early) or semantic (late)?

**New Gap #13**: No paper has mapped *where* in the Thinker-Talker pipeline emotional information is lost (connector bottleneck? early layers? attention heads?). EmoOmni motivates the question; Track 3's grounding_coefficient + logit-lens framework can answer it.

**Secondary insight**: EmoOmni's E-CoT approach is essentially forcing the model to make its intermediate representation explicit — a manual interpretability scaffold. Mechanistic tools could discover the same structure automatically.

## Summary
- 5 new cs.SD papers scanned (Feb 26 batch)
- 4 irrelevant; 1 (EmoOmni) yields Gap #13: connector bottleneck as emotional information loss site
- Gap #13 extends Track 3 and connects to Track 5 (Thinker-Talker = audio safety interface)
- No new must-reads generated; EmoOmni is "useful context" not "core paper"

## Next: 
- Still waiting for Leo to wake up. Queue: real speech test > venv+nnsight > IIT experiment design
- If another 30-min cycle triggers before Leo wakes (5:30 AM): cs.CL scan worth checking
- This cycle is the last productive overnight scan unless new MI-relevant submissions appear
