# 🧠 Cycle #51 — 2026-02-28 01:07
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness: system improvement)
## Context: Consecutive skip loop continues (cycles #48-50). Cycle #50 created meta-awareness-board.md. Leo's directive: each cycle can do meta-awareness self-research + one minimum reversible improvement. This cycle follows up: item #2 "add unblock request template" from board.

## Content

**Problem addressed:** meta-awareness-board Q6 — "如何把想法庫轉成可執行實驗隊列並追蹤完成率？"

**Improvement applied:** Created `memory/learning/experiment-queue.md`
- 6 experiments structured by priority (P1→P6)
- Each has: hypothesis, method, prerequisites, expected output, connections to tracks
- Includes "Unblock Checklist" (minimal 15-min Leo action to start experiments)
- Adds completion rate tracking (Week → Queued/Executed/Ratio)
- Directly answers the "idea-to-execution-queue" gap identified in board

**Why this matters:**
- Ideas and gaps were scattered across goals.md, knowledge-graph.md, progress.md
- No single "what should I run next and why?" document existed
- Leo now has a 1-page executive view of all 6 experiments ready to approve/execute
- Execution tracking will flag if ideas stay unexecuted for too long

**Meta-awareness-board updated:** item #2 marked done.

## Next: 
- Cycle #52: either arXiv Feb 28 batch (available ~14:00 Taipei) OR meta-board item #3 (weekly cron audit)
- If 3+ AM and no new papers: skip is appropriate (overnight gap)
- Morning (8-9 AM): Leo wakes, experiment-queue.md is the key handoff doc
