# 🧠 Cycle #82 — 2026-02-28 16:32
## Action: reflect (meta-synthesis — Gap #18 experimental design)
## Context: Meta-awareness cron; last cycle (#81) just identified Gap #18 (phonological vector geometry through connector). arXiv Feb 28 batch still not posted at 16:31 PM. Execution-blocked. Best action = synthesize Gap #18 into a concrete experiment design while it's fresh.

## Content: Gap #18 Experiment Design — "Phonological Geometry Through the Connector"

### Background (from cycle #81)
Choi et al. (2602.18899) proved that phonological features in S3M encoders (HuBERT/WavLM/wav2vec2.0) are **linear, compositional, and scale-continuous** across 96 languages:
- `[b] = [d] - [t] + [p]` (voicing arithmetic works)
- Magnitude scales with degree of acoustic realization
- Cross-lingual: universal phonological vectors

**Gap #18**: Does this linear phonological geometry **survive through the connector into the speech LLM's residual stream?**
- If YES → LLM has structured phonological access → "listening" is phonologically coherent
- If NO → connector destroys geometry → modality collapse, grounding fails

### Why This Matters
- This is a **direct test of the Connector Bottleneck hypothesis** (from Gap #14, Modality Collapse 2602.23136)
- It's **causal**: if geometry survives, causal interventions on phonological vectors should propagate through connector
- It's a **prerequisite for Paper A**: if grounding_coefficient is to make sense, the model must have access to phonological structure in the LLM residual stream
- It's also **prerequisite for Audio T-SAE (Idea #7)**: T-SAE learns smooth features assuming there ARE phonological priors to exploit

### Proposed Experiment: "Phonological Geometry Probe"

**Step 1: Extract phonological direction vectors from S3M**
```python
# For Whisper-small encoder (proxy for S3M)
# Use LibriSpeech minimal pairs from Choi et al. code (github.com/juice500ml/phonetic-arithmetic)
# Compute: voicing_vector = h([d]) - h([t])  (voiced minus voiceless stop pair)
# Compute: nasality_vector = h([n]) - h([l])  (nasal minus lateral)
# Both at the encoder's output layer (post-connector input)
```

**Step 2: Project through connector (via NNsight)**
```python
# Hook the connector module's output
# For Qwen2-Audio: audio_encoder.connector or similar
# Get projected representation of voiced vs voiceless phoneme tokens
# Compute: connector_voicing_vec = projected_h([d]) - projected_h([t])
```

**Step 3: Test geometry in LLM residual stream**
```python
# Arithmetic test: does projected_h([b]) ≈ projected_h([d]) - projected_h([t]) + projected_h([p])?
# Metric: cosine similarity of arithmetic result vs actual projection
# Baseline: random vectors → expected ~0
# Choi et al. result in S3M: ~0.7-0.9 (high)
# Hypothesis: connector degrades this to <0.3 (geometry destroyed) OR maintains it >0.6 (geometry survives)
```

**Step 4: Layer-wise test**
```python
# For each LLM layer 0-N: probe for voicing_vector direction
# Use linear probe: can we decode voiced vs voiceless from LLM layer L hidden states?
# If probe acc drops sharply post-connector → connector is the bottleneck
# If probe acc maintained → geometry survives connector
```

### MacBook Feasibility Assessment
- **Model**: Whisper-small (6 layers, 244M params) for Step 1 ✅ MacBook OK
- **S3M minimal pairs**: reuse Choi et al. code (public, no GPU needed for extraction) ✅
- **Connector test**: needs Qwen2-Audio or similar LALM → too large for MacBook ❌
  - Alternative: **use Whisper encoder output as S3M proxy, test on AudioLens architecture (DeSTA2)** — DeSTA2 is smaller
  - OR: use NDIF to access Qwen2-Audio remotely via NNsight
- **Time estimate**: 2-4h with NDIF/DeSTA2, or 1-2 days if waiting for 戰艦 GPU

### Connection Map
```
Gap #18 (Phonological Geometry Through Connector)
    ├── Paper A ("Listen Layer") — prerequisite: connector must preserve something → localization makes sense
    ├── Paper B (AudioSAEBench) — TCS(F) metric assumes phonological features exist in LLM → need to confirm
    ├── Idea #7 (Audio T-SAE) — temporal contrastive training assumes phoneme-level features recoverable
    └── Gap #14 (Modality Collapse, 2602.23136) — GMI theory predicts encoding BUT decoding fails → our test distinguishes encoding vs geometry preservation
```

### Research Value Assessment
- **Novelty**: HIGH — Choi et al. didn't test this; nobody has. Gap #18 is genuinely open.
- **Feasibility**: MEDIUM (needs NDIF or small LALM; minimal pair stimuli already exist)
- **Publishability**: YES — but likely as *part of* Paper A or Paper B, not standalone
  - Could be Figure 2 of Paper A: "Phonological geometry survives encoder, degrades/maintains through connector → explains listen layer location"
  - Could be Category 0 of AudioSAEBench: prerequisite validation before SAE evaluation

### Idea Gate Quick Check
- Competitors: Choi et al. only tested within S3M; nobody tested through connector
- arXiv gap queries (done this cycle): 0 results for "connector phonological geometry" or "connector bottleneck phonological"
- Verdict: 🟢 GREEN — integrate into Paper A/B as sub-experiment, not standalone

### Meta-Awareness Note
This synthesis happened 30 min after discovery (cycle #81). The Q7 rule (synthesis threshold after 10 reads) is working correctly — this is the kind of synthesis that prevents ideas from decaying before they're actionable.

One system improvement applied this cycle: **Gap #18 added to experiment-queue.md as Priority 0 (prerequisite check)** — because it's a necessary condition for Paper A's grounding_coefficient to be meaningful.

## Next: 
- arXiv Feb 28 batch when it posts (~18:00? — unusual delay, check cs.SD)
- Gap #18 experiment added to experiment-queue.md (done this cycle)
- Leo unblock still needed for execution
