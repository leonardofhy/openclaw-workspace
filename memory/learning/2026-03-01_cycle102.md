# 🧠 Cycle #102 — 2026-03-01 02:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness audit)
## Context: Cron label = "meta-awareness". Weekend Protocol all 3 options exhausted (a: #99 citation trail, b: #101 DAS paper, c: #98 Gap#18 pre-flight doc). Per guard rule: cannot bypass via "meta-board saturated" — must open Q14+ and apply one concrete improvement. arXiv ~11h away (Monday batch ~14:00 Taipei). Execution-blocked continues.

## Meta-Awareness Audit: Q14 — DAS Upgrade Risk Assessment

**Question (Q14):** The DAS upgrade to gc(k) is theoretically sound, but does it introduce new assumptions or failure modes that could break Paper A's claims?

### DAS Assumption Analysis (for Paper A)

**Assumption 1: The audio grounding variable is linearly encodable in the residual stream**
- DAS learns a *rotation* (linear change of basis) → this only works if the causal variable is in a *linear subspace*
- Evidence FOR: Linear Representation Hypothesis (Mikolov, Park et al.) broadly confirmed in text; Choi et al. (2602.18899) confirms linear phonological geometry in S3M models → audio representations ARE linear
- Evidence AGAINST: Connector bottleneck may create non-linear projections → Gap #18 pre-flight tests this
- **Risk level:** MEDIUM. Gap #18 experiment (Priority 0) doubles as linearity validation. If phonological geometry doesn't survive connector, DAS assumption is fragile for full LALM (Qwen2-Audio); Whisper-only claim is still valid.
- **Mitigation:** Phase 1 (Whisper-small) doesn't involve a connector — linearity assumption safer. Phase 2 (Qwen2-Audio) reports both vanilla patching AND DAS-IIA; discrepancy = a finding, not a failure.

**Assumption 2: The "listen vs guess" variable is binary (clean audio-grounded vs text-predicted)**
- DAS needs a well-defined high-level causal model. Binary is clean. But grounding may be graded.
- **Risk level:** LOW. The ALME 57K stimuli (Li et al.) are designed as binary conflict pairs — audio answer ≠ text answer. Binary causal model fits these stimuli directly.
- **Mitigation:** Report graded gc(k) = IIA as continuous (not binary threshold). DAS loss is already continuous.

**Assumption 3: DAS learns the RIGHT subspace (not a spurious correlate)**
- Gradient descent could find a subspace that satisfies the IIT objective without being the *semantically meaningful* grounding subspace
- **Risk level:** MEDIUM. Standard in DAS literature — addressed by cross-generalization: train DAS on clean/corrupt audio minimal pairs; test on NEW minimal pairs (different phonemes, different speakers). If IIA holds on held-out pairs → subspace is generalizing, not overfitting.
- **Mitigation:** 80/20 train/test split on Choi et al. stimuli. Cross-generalization = Paper A Figure 3.

**Assumption 4: IIA peak layer = "where audio grounding happens" (causal claim)**
- IIA peak could reflect where the *probe* is easiest (high linear separability) rather than where grounding causally occurs
- **Risk level:** MEDIUM. This is the PROBE_LAYER ≠ INTERVENE_LAYER issue (already in Paper A v0.2 method). Resolved by sweeping both independently.
- **Mitigation:** Report gc(L_probe, L_intervene) as 2D heatmap. Primary claim = diagonal (L_probe = L_intervene). Supplements show off-diagonal effects.

**Assumption 5: gc(k) = DAS-IIA is a better metric than vanilla patching for "the" listen layer**
- DAS may find a DIFFERENT layer than vanilla patching. Is that the "real" listen layer, or an artifact?
- **Insight from cycle #101:** In the NLI case, DAS found that "entailment" is two word-identity representations — DAS revealed TRUE structure that localist patching MISSED. In Leo's case: DAS may reveal that "audio grounding" is distributed across layers (not a single sharp peak), while vanilla patching shows nothing because the subspace is distributed within each layer.
- **If DAS and vanilla disagree:** DAS wins (theoretically). Vanilla patching = localist assumption = wrong for polysemantic neurons.
- **Risk level:** LOW. Disagreement is a FINDING, not a failure. "We show DAS reveals a listen layer that vanilla patching misses" = stronger paper.

### Summary Risk Table

| Assumption | Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| Linear audio representations | MEDIUM | Gap #18 pre-test + Whisper-only claim | 🟡 Manageable |
| Binary listen/guess | LOW | ALME stimuli are binary by design | ✅ |
| DAS finds right subspace | MEDIUM | Cross-generalization held-out test | 🟡 Manageable |
| IIA peak = causal | MEDIUM | 2D probe×intervene sweep | 🟡 Manageable |
| DAS > vanilla | LOW | Disagreement = finding, not failure | ✅ |

**Verdict:** No showstopper risks. All 5 assumptions are manageable with planned experiments. Paper A method is sound. Risk list should be added to paper-a-pitch.md as a "Known Risks" section for Leo's review.

## Applied Improvement: Add Risk Checklist to paper-a-pitch.md

**Rule (now written):** Before running any experiment in Phase 1 or 2 of Paper A, review the 5 DAS assumption risks above. If Gap #18 fails (connector destroys phonological geometry), scope Paper A Phase 2 claims to "encoder-only grounding" (Whisper), not full LALM.

→ Will append to paper-a-pitch.md now (reversible: 1 new section, no existing content changed).

## Meta-Board State Update

| Q | Status |
|---|--------|
| Q1-Q13 | ✅ All answered (previous sessions) |
| **Q14** | ✅ ANSWERED: DAS gc(k) risk table complete. 5 assumptions, all manageable. Contingency = Gap #18 guards LALM claims. |

**Q15 (open):** What is the correct WER-sensitivity threshold for declaring gc(L) "significant"? Paper A needs a principled α-level for the IIA significance test. (Leave for next meta session or when Leo is active.)

## Self-Assessment: Cycles #96-102 (Weekend Block)

| Cycle | Action | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| #96 | skip | LOW (guard-correct, but 1st skip = edge of meta-board saturation) |
| #97 | skip | LOW (2nd skip — should have triggered guard sooner) |
| #98 | reflect (meta-awareness) | HIGH — wrote Weekend Protocol rule, 3 improvements |
| #99 | learn (citation trail) | MEDIUM-HIGH — Gap #20 candidate + lab cluster map |
| #100 | reflect (milestone) | HIGH — 100-cycle retrospective, Idea Gate for Gap #20 |
| #101 | learn (DAS foundational) | HIGH — upgraded gc(k) to DAS-IIA, 4 new open questions |
| **#102** | **reflect (meta-awareness)** | **MEDIUM-HIGH — risk table for Paper A, Q14 answered, Q15 opened** |

**Weekend novelty ratio: 5/7 = 71%** ✅ (target: ≥65%)
**Weekend Protocol: all 3 options exhausted ✅**
**Improvements applied this weekend: 4** (Weekend Protocol rule, pre-flight doc, Gap #18 experiment design, DAS risk table)

## Next Cycles (ordered)

1. **#103 (now, if cycling):** Sleep — 2:31 AM, no new high-value action after this meta-audit. First true skip since Weekend Protocol rule.
2. **#104-onwards (~14:00 Monday):** arXiv scan — cs.SD + cs.CL + cs.AI batch expected
3. **If Leo wakes before arXiv:** Relay unblock-request.md → Priority 0 experiment (Gap #18 phonological geometry check)

## Key Outputs This Cycle
1. **DAS gc(k) risk table**: 5 assumptions, 3 manageable risks, 2 low-risk. Paper A is methodologically sound.
2. **Q14 answered**: Gap #18 pre-test guards the most critical assumption (linearity through connector)
3. **Q15 opened**: WER sensitivity threshold for gc(L) significance — leave for active session or Leo
4. **Weekend KPI**: 71% novelty ratio ✅ (exceeded 65% target)
5. **Risk section**: to be appended to paper-a-pitch.md
