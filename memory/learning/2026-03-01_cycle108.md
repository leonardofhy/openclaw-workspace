# 🧠 Cycle #108 — 2026-03-01 05:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — Sunday morning readiness audit)
## Context: Cron explicitly tagged "meta-awareness". 5:31 AM Sunday. Meta-board at 19/19 Qs. Weekend Protocol options all exhausted this weekend (citation trail #99, foundational paper DAS #101, pre-flight doc #98). Last 8 cycles were all reflect/meta — Q20 territory: "Is the system actually ready for Leo to act, or is it generating cosmetic readiness?"

## Q20: Is the Sunday Morning Handoff Actually Ready?

**Question:** After 38h execution-blocked and 107 cycles of preparation, has the system created a clear, action-ready handoff for Leo — or is it spread across too many files?

### Audit: What Leo Would Need to Start Experiments Today

| Document | Location | Status | Leo Needs to Read? |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| Paper A pitch v0.2 | `memory/learning/paper-a-pitch.md` | ✅ READY | Yes (20 min) |
| Paper B pitch v0.4 | `memory/learning/paper-b-pitch.md` | ✅ READY | Yes (10 min) |
| Experiment queue + unblock steps | `memory/learning/experiment-queue.md` | ✅ READY | Yes (5 min) |
| Unblock request | `memory/learning/unblock-request.md` | ✅ READY | Yes (2 min) |
| Day-1 session plan | `memory/learning/2026-02-28_cycle88.md` | ✅ READY | No (superseded by unblock-request.md) |
| knowledge-graph.md | `memory/learning/knowledge-graph.md` | ✅ Deep, not for quick read | Reference only |
| meta-awareness-board.md | `memory/learning/meta-awareness-board.md` | ✅ Comprehensive | Not needed for experiment start |

**Verdict:** 4 documents are enough: `unblock-request.md` → `paper-a-pitch.md` → `paper-b-pitch.md` → `experiment-queue.md`. Total reading time: ~40 minutes.

### What's Missing?

One gap identified: **The documents assume Leo reads them sequentially, but there's no single "START HERE" index file** that orients Leo in under 2 minutes.

**Q20 Resolution:** Create a lightweight `memory/learning/SUNDAY-BRIEF.md` — a 1-page index that:
1. States the current situation in 3 sentences
2. Points to the 4 files in order
3. Lists the 5-step unblock sequence (copy-pasteable)
4. Notes the key decisions Leo needs to make (approve IIT experiment, paper venue choice, contact 智凱哥)

**Applied improvement:** Write SUNDAY-BRIEF.md now (this cycle).

## Content: Sunday Morning Brief Written

See: `memory/learning/SUNDAY-BRIEF.md` (created this cycle)

Key structure:
- Status snapshot (3 sentences)
- 4 files to read (ordered, estimated time)
- 5-step unblock commands (copy-paste ready)
- 3 decisions for Leo
- What happens after unblock (autonomous for 3h)

---

## Micro-reflect
- This cycle produced genuine value: the "START HERE" gap was real, the brief is actionable
- Q20 is a meta-question about meta-readiness — appropriate for a 38h-blocked meta-awareness cycle
- After writing the brief: genuine principled skip is correct until arXiv Monday batch (~14:00)
- No new Qs to open — system is prepared, Leo's move

## Next
- Skip until arXiv Monday batch (~14:00 Taipei) OR Leo wakes up (~9 AM) and reviews SUNDAY-BRIEF.md
- If Leo reviews and approves: run Priority 1 experiment (IIT Triple Convergence, ~3h autonomous)
- Meta-board: open Q20 (answered this cycle) = 20/20 Qs
