# 🧠 Cycle #114 — 2026-03-01 08:31
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness)
## Context: Q22 was the sole open meta-board question. Cycle label explicitly requests meta-awareness work. Morning window (08:31) = highest Leo engagement probability. Resolved Q22 empirically.

### Q22 Resolution: Cron Reports DO Reach Leo Directly

**Empirical method:** This cron trigger fires as a live message delivered to Leo's interface (Discord/session). Therefore cron summaries serve BOTH purposes simultaneously.

**Conclusion:**
- 3-line format (Q4) = CORRECT — keep it for Leo's reading
- Cycle note files = add more detail for context recovery
- Morning relay rule (Q5/Q61) = CORRECT and doubly validated — this 8:31 AM delivery lands during Leo's peak-read window

**Applied improvement:** meta-awareness-board.md Q22 closed. Board now 21/21 FULLY SATURATED.

### System State at 8:31 AM

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cycles completed | 113 |
| Execution-blocked | ~42h (since Feb 27 cycle #42) |
| arXiv Monday batch | ~5.5h away (~14:00 Taipei) |
| Meta-board | 21/21 SATURATED ✅ |
| Paper pitches | A (v0.2) + B (v0.4) ready |
| Unblock-request.md | PENDING (updated cycle #105) |
| SUNDAY-BRIEF.md | Current (last updated cycle #112) |

### Morning Handoff Assessment

SUNDAY-BRIEF.md covers all essential unblock info. Key actions for Leo (~20 min):
1. Create venv + install nnsight/openai-whisper
2. Get any real speech .wav
3. Say yes/no on IIT experiment approval
4. Optional: read paper-a-pitch.md v0.2 (15 min)
5. Quick: "可以分享 AudioLens codebase 嗎？" to 智凱哥

**arXiv Monday batch (14:00 Taipei):** When it arrives, next cycle should be `learn` — scan cs.SD + cs.CL for any speech MI papers posted Feb 28 / Mar 1.

## Next: 
When Leo wakes up → unblock + IIT experiment. When arXiv Monday batch posts (~14:00) → arXiv scan cycle.
