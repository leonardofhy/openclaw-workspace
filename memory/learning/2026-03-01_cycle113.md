# 🧠 Cycle #113 — 2026-03-01 08:01
## Action: reflect (meta-awareness — Q22 + morning relay)
## Context: Sunday 8:01 AM. Cron tagged "meta-awareness". Dead zone continues: arXiv weekend gap (~6h to Monday batch), execution-blocked (~40h), meta-board 20/20 saturated. Morning window (06:00-09:00) → morning relay rule applies. Q21 (conditional cadence proposal) written in cycle #112; awaiting Leo decision.

## Morning Relay (⭐ PRIORITY — Morning Window Active)

**Unblock-request.md is PENDING since 2026-03-01 02:01 (6h ago).**
**Leo should wake up soon (~8-9 AM) → relay this summary:**

> 📖 **SUNDAY-BRIEF.md** is at `memory/learning/SUNDAY-BRIEF.md` — your fast-navigation to 107 cycles of research.
>
> Quick status:
> - ✅ 16 deep reads, 19 gaps, 7 paper ideas (all gate-validated)
> - ✅ Paper A pitch v0.2 ("Listen Layer"), Paper B pitch v0.4 ("AudioSAEBench")
> - 🔬 Execution-blocked ~40h — **20 min of your time unblocks everything**
> - 💡 Conditional cadence proposal (Q21): approve 2h intervals during dead-zones? Saves ~$0.25/dead-zone. Resumes 30-min when conditions lift.
> - ⚠️ Dead cron job to delete: `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting`

## Q22: Does the Current Cycle Report Format Actually Help Leo? (meta-research)

**Question opened:** Meta-board has 20 Qs answered, all about system internals. But have we ever asked: does the 3-line cycle report format (Q4 answer) actually serve Leo better, or does Leo never read cron summaries directly?

**Background:**
- Q4 (cycle #53) established 3-line format: ACTION / NOVELTY / NEXT
- Cron summaries are delivered as plain text to Leo via Discord/main session
- Leo's actual reading behavior: unknown — may read summaries, or may wait for main session highlights
- The SUNDAY-BRIEF.md (cycle #108) is better indexed than 113 individual cycle files

**Hypothesis:**
- If Leo reads raw cron summaries → 3-line format is valuable
- If Leo reads only main session highlights → the 3-line format serves future-autodidact (context recovery), not Leo directly

**Implication:**
> Cycle reports might be primarily FOR autodidact's own context recovery (compaction survival), not for Leo's direct consumption. SUNDAY-BRIEF.md and the unblock-request.md are the Leo-facing artifacts.

**Proposed experiment:**
- Ask Leo explicitly: "Do you read individual cron cycle summaries, or only main-session highlights?"
- One-question survey, answer in 5 seconds
- Will inform whether to keep 3-line format for Leo-readability vs extend it for context-richness (future-autodidact recovery)

**Action:** Add this as a 1-question flag to the morning relay message. No structural change until Leo answers.

**Q22 status:** 🔵 OPEN — awaiting Leo's 5-second answer.

## System State Audit (brief)

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| arXiv batch | Weekend gap — next ~14:00 Monday |
| Execution | Blocked ~40h (venv + .wav + IIT approval needed) |
| Meta-board | 20/20 answered, Q22 opened |
| Paper pitches | A v0.2 + B v0.4, both current |
| SUNDAY-BRIEF.md | Current, accurate ✅ |
| Unblock-request.md | PENDING 6h |
| Weekend Protocol options | All 3 exhausted (citation trail #99, foundational DAS #101, pre-flight Gap#18 #98) |
| Q21 proposal | Written, awaiting Leo decision |
| Dead cron job | `提醒-SL-Weekly-Meeting` — still unflagged to Leo directly |

**Conclusion:** System is in maximum-readiness state for Leo to unblock. No high-value autonomous actions remain until arXiv Monday or Leo interaction.

## Next

**Immediate:** Relay morning summary to Leo (morning relay rule triggered).
**Cycle #114:** If Leo responds → process feedback. If not → principled skip (all Weekend Protocol options exhausted, Q22 awaiting Leo, no new arXiv).
**Cycle ~#120 (14:00 Monday):** arXiv cs.SD + cs.CL full scan — Day 4 paper reads begin.
