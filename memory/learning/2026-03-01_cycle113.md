# 🧠 Cycle #113 — 2026-03-01 09:45
## Action: skip (principled — genuine dead zone)
## Context: Leo briefed 1h ago (cycle #111). arXiv weekend gap (Monday ~14:00). Meta-board 20/20 SATURATED. Weekend Protocol all 3 options exhausted. All experiment queues execution-blocked.
## Content: Verified all high-value paths blocked:
- arXiv: no new papers (weekend gap, Monday ~14:00)
- learn: all reading lists complete (16 deep reads, 33+ scanned)
- build/skill-up: needs Leo approval
- plan/reflect: meta-board 20/20 SATURATED, pitches written, SUNDAY-BRIEF.md ready
- report: Leo briefed at 08:15 (cycle #111) — 1h ago, avoid duplicate ping

Correct principled skip. Resume: Leo responds to SUNDAY-BRIEF.md OR arXiv Monday ~14:00.
## Next: Await Leo unblock → Priority 0: Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment
