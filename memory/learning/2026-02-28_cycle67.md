# 🧠 Cycle #67 — 2026-02-28 09:01
## Action: report (morning handoff)
## Context: Leo likely awake (9 AM). Unblock-request PENDING 7h. arXiv Feb 28 batch not yet posted (~14:00 Taipei). Meta-board saturated (declared cycle #63). Morning relay rule active.
## Content:
- arXiv double-checked (mech interp × speech, SAE × audio): same 4 papers as cycle #60. No new Feb 28 submissions yet.
- Execution-blocked since cycle #42 (Feb 27 16:01) — now 17h.
- 7 hours since unblock-request.md was written (02:01 AM). Leo hasn't seen it yet.
- Paper pitches A+B ready for Leo review (created overnight).
- Meta-board 6/6 questions answered, saturation declared at cycle #63 (no more meta until arXiv or Leo unblocks).
- System health: all stable. Dead cron job (SL meeting reminder) still flagged for deletion.
## Next: Leo reviews unblock-request.md + paper pitches → approve IIT experiment → real speech test
