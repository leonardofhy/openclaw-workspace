# 🧠 Cycle #164 — 2026-03-02 09:31
## Action: plan (experiment integration — Gap #21 codec-grounded patching protocol)
## Context: Cycle #163 (30 min ago) synthesized Gap #21 and identified RVQ-layer-selective corruption as a preprocessing tool for all 6 existing experiments. Explicitly noted: "Integration target: experiment-queue.md as a preprocessing tool for all 6 existing experiments (P0-P6). Not a standalone paper." This cycle closes that open integration action. arXiv Monday batch still ~4.5h away (~14:00 Taipei). Meta Budget SPENT. No new arXiv. This is a concrete, no-Leo-needed design improvement.

## Content

### Action taken: Updated experiment-queue.md
Added **"Cross-Cutting Preprocessing: Codec-Grounded Causal Patching (Gap #21)"** as a new top-level section before the Queue Status block.

**What was added:**
- Full attribute-selective corruption framework from SpeechTokenizer semantics (Layer 1 = content, Layers 2+ = acoustic)
- Table: 3 corruption strategies (semantic-only / acoustic-only / full replacement)
- Integration map: specific connection to P0 (Gap #18), P1 (IIT), P2 (Listen Layer), P4 (Neuron Grounding), P5 (AudioSAEBench)
- Prerequisites note: `pip install speechtokenizer` — MacBook-feasible
- Gap #21 status reminder (fully open, 6 queries = 0 results)
- Core Research Q#1 answer: "audio clean/corrupt 怎麼設計才只破壞你要隔離的因素?" → ANSWERED via RVQ layer semantics

### Why this is high value
- Directly addresses Core Research Q#1 (goals.md) — the first complete answer to this question
- Applies to ALL 6 queued experiments without needing new experiments
- Gives P0 (Gap #18 phonological geometry) sharper experimental design: patch Layer 1 only to isolate phonological content without acoustic confound (speaker identity, pitch unchanged)
- Gives P2 (Listen Layer Paper) a sharper ALME conflict signal: semantic content flipped (Layer 1) while speaker voice preserved (Layer 2+) = purer audio-text conflict stimulus
- For P4 (emotion neurons): enables distinction between acoustic vs linguistic emotion pathways — directly sharpens the grounding_coefficient neuron-level test

### State after this cycle
- experiment-queue.md: fully integrated Gap #21 codec-grounded patching
- goals.md Core Q#1: can add "See Gap #21 + experiment-queue.md §Preprocessing" pointer (low priority)
- arXiv Monday batch: still ~4.5h away
- Execution-blocked: ~62h
- Meta Budget: SPENT (25/25 Qs, no new Qs opened this cycle — none warranted)

### Assessment
This was the correct action: cycle #163 identified integration target explicitly, cycle #164 executed it. No Leo needed. Reversible (file edit). Value: HIGH — closes the only loose thread from the two-cycle Sadok et al. learn sequence.

## Next: 
- arXiv Monday ~14:00 → first `learn` cycle of the week (high-value scan of weekend submissions — likely 20-30+ cs.SD papers)
- OR Leo unblocks → Priority 0 Gap #18 phonological geometry experiment (full spec now including Layer 1 token isolation)
