## Under-explored gaps with concrete experiment ideas

- **End-to-end “ASR → LLM → tool” prompt injection benchmarks are still thin.**  
  Experiment: build a controlled suite where the *same* harmful intent is delivered as (i) clean text, (ii) clean speech transcripted by multiple ASR models, and (iii) speech with *benign-sounding* ambiguities (homophones, punctuation loss, disfluencies). Measure downstream tool-call safety errors (unauthorized actions, mis-executions) and compare to transcript-only evaluations. Ground the threat framing in “LLM-powered ASR evaluation” and real-world audio manipulation results. citeturn28view3turn32view4  

- **Defense generalization against compositional audio scenes (overlap, non-speech mixing) is under-tested across languages.**  
  Experiment: extend SACRED-Bench-style compositions to multilingual and code-switched audio; evaluate SALMONN-Guard-style guards for false positives/negatives and build an *adaptive attacker* that varies overlap ratio, speaker count, accent, and non-speech masking. citeturn24view0turn15view0  

- **Mechanistic interpretability rarely targets *safety behaviors* (refusal circuits / jailbreak “switches”) in speech models.**  
  Experiment: replicate “representation cluster separation” interpretations (benign vs harmful zones) with causal interventions (activation patching / causal tracing) on a speech LALM; identify minimal internal components whose edits shift refusal/answer boundaries, then test whether those same components mediate audio jailbreak transfer. Use interpretability approaches demonstrated for ASR and LoRA-adaptation as the workflow template. citeturn17view5turn25view0turn33view0  

- **Alignment tax measurement in speech is not standardized (especially over-refusal vs safety vs conversational quality).**  
  Experiment: define a tri-objective frontier: (1) jailbreak resistance (multiple attack families), (2) over-refusal on benign but sensitive queries (including “smart home” ambiguous commands), and (3) speech conversational quality (turn-taking, interruptions). Then compare RRS-like tuning, steering-like approaches, and guard models under the same frontier evaluation. citeturn33view0turn28view4turn35view0  

- **Deception mitigation work is mostly text-first; speech adds persuasive prosody and perceived authority.**  
  Experiment: port multi-turn deception evaluation to speech agents by synthesizing multiple prosodic “confidence styles” (neutral, authoritative, empathetic) while holding transcript constant, then measure changes in deception detection metrics and human susceptibility. Use “human fooling” and vishing perception results as baseline calibration for what styles are most risky. citeturn29view0turn31view0turn28view6
