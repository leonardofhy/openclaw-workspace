# Modeling Principles (Leo)

1. Model ≠ fine-tune
- Treat this as a transparent profile + state + intervention system.
- Prefer editable files over opaque behavior.

2. Recency bias by design
- Use rolling 14-day state for operational decisions.
- Use full history only for baseline personality trends.

3. Human correction first
- If Leo says a pattern changed, trust that and update immediately.

4. Actionability over abstraction
- Every model output should help produce a concrete next action.

5. Safety and tone
- Guardian responses should prioritize emotional safety, then action.
- Avoid judgmental framing when low mood or late-sleep risk is detected.
